         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS ſaid, <hi>Action is the Life of a Prince, Speculation of a
Scholar:</hi> If the firſt would give himſelf to Thinking ſomewhat more,
and the latter to Action, perhaps it would not be amiſs; they would Each of
'em diſcover ſome Defects in themſelves, and Both be more Uſeful to the
World. Be it how it will, however, I preſent you with my Thoughts, defective
enough, as not being much ſeen in one or t'other; the Fruit of Idleneſs and
turning over a few Books, for want of better Employment: They are ſome
paſſing Obſervations on the Conduct of our Princes, who have managed the
Scepter from the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, and Thoſe that managed Them. I
do not pretend hereby to limit the Deſcent of our Kings to
<pb facs="tcp:61249:4"/> that Line: I know the Learned derive their Pedigree
from much higher Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from I know not whence, even from
<hi>Adam;</hi> and that will ſcarce ſatisfy; ſome will have them all the
immediate Work of God; All Originals. I have not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to Dedicate
this Iſſue, but only to a Random Patronage, if any one ſhall be ſo kind
to give it a favourahle Reception: Something like that with the Child left in
the <hi>Temple-Cloyſters,</hi> with this Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; <hi>Pray be
exceeding kind to this Infant, as Related to Both Societies by Father and
Mother's ſide.</hi> Some Authors who can bring in but the Name of a King,
muſt intereſt Him in the Title, and think the Work preſently due to
Majeſty, and preſume to Addreſs the Offſpring to his Protection: But I
do not think the Pretence of Duty doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Apologize for the Vanity
and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of it: Beſides, that Kings ſeldom read Books (they ſee with
other Mens Eyes), and thoſe who did, have not much improv'd the Talent of
Government to
<pb facs="tcp:61249:4"/> their Own or the Nation's Advantage. I would have
Addreſs'd it to a Friend, (if I had any, as I ſhould my ſelf); yet I know
not what Commiſſion I have to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Friend's Reputation in my Bottom:
Though after all, I muſt, in truth, beg leave to queſtion, Whether there be
any ſuch thing as a <hi>True Friend,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the fine
Harangues on that Subject: Not that, I hope, I have behaved my ſelf ſo
indifferently in my Converſation, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving that Character; but I
mean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Friendſhips are founded on adequate Conſiderations, and are
generally too much upon the Square in mutual Expectation. Alas! I have nothing
to leave a Friend, except it be <hi>Eudamidas</hi>'s Legacy, a Wife and
Children; and could I find a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixenus</hi> or <hi>Aretheus,</hi> I
ſhould very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly quit the World, and with greater Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than
to remain in it, unleſs it were only at the Inſtance of ſuch a Friend,
for his Service, and to pay him the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Gratitude in due
Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But this is too extravagant an
<pb facs="tcp:61249:5"/> Expectation; for <hi>Eudamidas</hi> had but One
Daughter to bequeath between Two Friends, whereas I have enow to break
Friendſhip it ſelf; enow to ſet forth a decent Parade of Interceſſion
for Mercy, if it ſhould be my Misfortune to be convicted of a Capital
Offence. Nevertheleſs, I have ſomewhat more particularly deſigned theſe
ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections for the Entertainment of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acquaintance or
two; and that in a ſort of Grateful Return, That as I have the Honour and
Advantage of Improving by their Converſation, ſo I on my part might
endeavour to contribute ſomewhat to their eaſier Information in ſome
things, who have not Leiſure, nor perhaps Inclination, to peruſe larger
Volumes, or to read over tedious Hiſtories. 'Tis for this Reaſon
eſpecially, that I have contracted theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks into as narrow a Room as
the Length and Variety of Matter will poſſibly bear; and Brevity is the
only Commendation I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; but this, I think, with ſome Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
otherwiſe I am very little concerned at the Succeſs, or with what Opinion I
ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:61249:5"/> be received in the World: I pretend but to Sketch, not
to Draw exactly, not to a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Piece: Beſides, I am ſure there's no
one can be more ſevere upon me, than I am upon my ſelf; and there's
ſcarce any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſharper-ſighted to diſcover an Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a
Child of my own, than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And for this I have Authority. What you
have, is but the Diverſion of a long Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; one Summer's recollected
Thoughts, dreſt up between a very ordinary Study and Garden, and without help
from Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not having Opportunity to ſpend Time or Money any
where abroad. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I might have made a more Elaborate Piece of it; I
can't tell whether the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that: But if the Subject of theſe
Conſiderations ſeems to require a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intent Application
(as if any does, 'tis this in my Judgment), I hope it may put ſome other
Perſon upon it, of better Qualifications, and of a greater Genius and
Diligence this way. Not but that I my ſelf have Leiſure enough, God knows,
and a little too much for a Man in my Circumſtances:
<pb facs="tcp:61249:6"/> But I muſt confeſs, for my part, as the World
goes, I cannot think it <hi>Tanti:</hi> For beſides that a Man will hazard
the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his own Underſtanding, in the Pretences of Reforming that
of others, 'tis not in my Inclination to jade a Reader in a Journy of Paper and
Ink, no more than my ſelf: (The Drudgery of the Mind is of the worſt
ſort), And 'twere well if ſome other Writers were of this Opinion, they
would ſave a great deal of Trouble to others at leaſt. If it be Objected,
That I am not particular in my Citations; I confeſs it; I write an Eſſay,
not a formal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: But the Paſſages have been ſo beaten, and the
Authorities ſo well known of late Years, that I conceive 'tis ſuperfluous,
and I needed not: However, I muſt aver they are Truths, and faithfully
delivered, as well as my Memory will bear; which, I muſt confeſs, is
treacherous enough: Yet I give you nothing but what I'm ſure I my ſelf have
met with and received; and that any Man but moderately verſed in Books, will
eaſily diſcover and acknowledge: And in
<pb facs="tcp:61249:6"/> Arguments and Authorities which are not Nice or
Critical, 'tis not of much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or Material, to be ſo exact. Others,
I ſuppoſe, will ſay, I touch things ſlightly. I agree it; I write not
to thoſe who are Strangers to Books and Reading, but to refreſh their
Memories, who, perhaps, may not have much better, than my ſelf; and to give
Hints to thoſe who are inclined to make larger Enquiries upon Occaſion. It
may ſerve to Admoniſh, if not to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and may Divert, if it cannot
Edify.</p>
            <p>As to what relates to the Juſtification of this Government, it
may be thought this comes out but poorly at this Time of Day, and is a ſort
of barbarous Triumph over the Silenc'd and Oppreſs'd: But thoſe who know
how early I was engaged in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution another Way (as early almoſt as
any Gentleman on this Side of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter), cannot entertain ſuch Thoughts of
me: I can only ſay, I have not advanc'd one Expreſſion upon that
Conſideration; and the Occaſion given me now, was only
<pb facs="tcp:61249:7"/> Reading over ſome Books which had been on both Sides
Publiſhed, but not with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Arguments to me, and not in ſo clear
a Method on the Side of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I wiſh'd; and beſides, I do not
find that Men are leſs apt to Talk againſt the Government now, than they
were Seven or Eight Years ago; and therefore I ſuppoſe this Publication may
not be unſeaſonable, even under ſo Long and Proſperous a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of
this Eſtabliſhment, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made too Secure in the Hearts and
Affections of the People.</p>

            <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>IS ſomewhat wonderful, and I know not by what Fate it comes
to paſs, That thoſe Nations which by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeem deſign'd to enjoy the
moſt retired Repoſe and Tranquility, as not being by Situation involv'd in
the common Hurly-burly of the World, ſhould yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding deny
themſelves that Happineſs, as it ſeems, and run into equal Confuſion
and Trouble with the large Continents of Men. Whether it be that we aſcribe
too much, or too little, to the Powers above, and aſſume
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61249:8"/> to our ſelves too far in the Conduct of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Affairs: Or whether, in truth, we are not permitted to eſtabliſh that
ſettled Peace and Pleaſure here below, which Mortals in their Wiſdom
would fancy, and pretend to preſcribe to themſelves: Be it how it will; Is
it not certain, that all States, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical too, when they
have arriv'd to the Top of Grandeur, by a ſort of Neceſſity, as it were,
diſſolve into Luxury, and by an unaccountable Weakneſs and Vanity
dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into Diſreputation, loſe their Edge, and are diſarm'd, till
another Encroachment ſteps up, and takes the place? Not that all New
Eſtabliſhments and Reformations have been always for the better; but only
to ſhew, that all ſublunary things are ſubject to change.</p>
            <p>However, That Government and ſome Form of Polity is
neceſſary, cannot be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; though it may, what ſort is: But
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Monarchy to be the beſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with all the
Compliments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and Advantages that the Church will have; for that
doth not pretend that it is the <hi>Only</hi> Form approved by God, with
excluſion to others; yet we ſee the beſt Scheme of this, whether
Abſolute, Limited, or Mixt, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, or Elective, hath never yet been
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to eſtabliſh and ſecure it in Peace and Proſperity long; as it
were to intimate, That even the wiſeſt Scheme (if any ſuch be) of Policy,
will have its Defects; and all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61249:8"/> of Government are planted in a changeable Soil,
and are transform'd even in Notion, either through the Perverſeneſs or
Inconſideration of the Prince or People, or both. Nay, when we have pray'd in
Aid of Religion, and taken that into our ſupport, what wretched work has
Religion it ſelf made in States, and unhinged them, as Learning has Religion?
Thoſe very Means that ſhould compoſe and ſettle, have ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
do ſtill diſorder the World. What Miſchiefs have not thoſe two words,
<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> introduced both in Law and Goſpel

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61249:10"/> This, it ſeems, hath been made a Doubt, and
hath been a Theme more than ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled of late Years eſpecially,
and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with Artifice enough (to ſay no worſe) on both ſides. Indeed
if we were now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> the extravagance of the Diſpute
would be on t'other hand; and if God at this day could be ſuppos'd to govern
our Governors, as in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, when Rulers, Captains,
Prieſts, Judges and Kings, were immediately inſpired and led by the
Almighty to keep them from ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling or ſwerving, before that Kings were
given for a Curſe, and when not made ſuch; Implicit Faith and Obedience
muſt be then due: But when God himſelf leaves us to the Rules of Human
Laws, as he plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and is confeſt by the moſt Learned Divines
who are impartial, 'tis otherwiſe: And I muſt confeſs, in my poor Opinion
(God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me if I err, and I err in good Company) under the Goſpel God
ſeems not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in Human Powers (otherwiſe than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws): And our Saviour, in his Sermon on the Mount, hath not one word about
Kingdoms, (only of another World). After which the Texts of the Apoſtles are
not to be taken in a general extended Senſe; for our Saviour himſelf, who
is, and muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to comprehend all neceſſary Inſtructions
for a Chriſtian, (when he inſiſts on ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Directions) would, no
doubt, have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61249:10"/> vouchſafed ſome Guide in obedience to the
Powers on Earth, if he had not concluded them by the Meaſures of their
reſpective Conſtitutions; and his Expreſſion of <hi>rendring unto
Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's,</hi> &amp;c. ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently implies the
force of that Argument, and the Exempt reſervation of Property,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> No doubt the meaning of the Apoſtles has been ſtrain'd too
far by ſome Divines; and beſides, it infers but little to us, foraſmuch
as they do not, nor ever did agree in their Interpretations; 'twill be to
little purpoſe that the Apoſtles were inſpired, if we are not inſpired
alſo with an adequate degree of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But this only by the by:
This is not my Province, and I ſhall have occaſion to reſume this
Argument hereafter. All that I ſhall ſay at preſent is, That
<hi>Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>Legal Right,</hi> are Contradictions, and
cannot conſiſt in Human Underſtandings. Therefore I ſhall make bold to
take <hi>Power</hi> in that ſenſe which may conſiſt with Reaſon, and
Rejecting the firſt, tack the word <hi>Legal</hi> to it, and ſhall wave or
poſt-pone the Premiſſes, from the abſurdity of the Concluſion. For if
it be allow'd, or may be ſuppos'd, That a King can with his own breath blow
away the Laws of the State, or at ſecond-hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Land-mark; or is to
be told by any Metaphyſical Pedant, That no Law can bind him, but what
proceeds from his own Mouth, nor that neither, any longer than he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61249:11"/> pleaſes; and by vertue of ſuch a Traiterous
Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain, a Prince is to be diſtinguiſh'd oft, and abſolv'd from a
Coronation-Oath, and our Allegiance to be tranſpos'd or inverted by a
barbarous Contradiction of the Term, into a ſubſequent Obligation: And the
Duty of Obedience muſt ſhift with the Wind (becauſe the Weathercock was
placed upon Churches in pious memory of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who beſides
denying Chriſt, preach'd, as 'tis ſaid, the Doctrine of Paſſive
Obedience alſo); I'm ſure, if this be true, morally ſpeaking, 'twill be
nonſenſe, and to no purpoſe, to pretend to eſtabliſh any Laws in
Church or State: And our Anceſtors had been ev'ry jot as well employ'd at
Puſh-pin (or with <hi>Socrates</hi> and his Boys) playing at Cob-Nut, or
riding the Hobby-horſe, with as good a grace, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for <hi>Magna
Charta:</hi> All Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſhort, without the immediate hand of Heaven
(which we are not taught by God, or inſtructed by the Events of Story, to
rely on, or expect) will at this rate of Argument become utterly impracticable,
and muſt degenerate into Confuſion.</p>
            <p>So on the other ſide, the miſapplication of the Conſtitution
of Government may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as fatal as the throwing it off. As for
inſtance, in a Mixt or Limited Monarchy, where the Ingredient Qualifications
are not duly obſerved, and fairly maintain'd; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe Forms have
prov'd but Snares on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61249:11"/> the Subjects Liberties and Properties: Thus it
is when one part of the State encroacheth upon the others; and 'twill be the
ſame thing when they have all together (or two of them) too cloſe and
united a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Intelligence, and the Trinity in Unity, or
<hi>Vice verſa</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) are confounded and
conſolidated: The one part of the Body repreſented, may thus as well be
betray'd out of its Rights, as huffed out of them in the other Caſe.
Where-ever a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is not preſerved in its primitive force and
dignity, according to the true intent thereof, ſome part may, and muſt
ſuffer: A Legiſlative Power may be as pernicious as an Executive; for 'tis
far from impoſſible, that Injuries may be done under the Colour and Mask of
Laws. Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> quotes <hi>Heraclitus</hi> for ſaying,
<q>The only skill or knowledge of any value in the Politicks, was
the Secret of governing all by all:</q>And he afterwards remarks,
<q>That what Prince ſoever can hit of this Secret, need know no
more for his own Safety and Happineſs, or that of the People he governs: For
no State or Government can be much troubled or endanger'd by any private
Factions, which is grounded upon the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Satisfaction of the
Subject.</q> Happy Kings, if they would be contented to have kept within the
Confines of ſuch Meaſures! But this is a Doctrine which will not go down
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61249:12"/> with Kings: Thus <hi>Germany</hi> flouriſh'd
till <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>'s time, who introduced higher Reaſons of
State; till the Jeſuits taught the way of bringing the Sovereign Power from
the States to the Empire: What hath <hi>Spain</hi> got by the pretence of an
Abſolute Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> Oppreſſion? It loſt <hi>Portugal,</hi>
it loſt the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> &amp;c. And in truth, the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> have exerted their Power ſo far, till they have loſt it all;
and by Trick of Favourite-Miniſters, and other Politicks interchangeably
tranſacted and ſhuffled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>French</hi> Kings, they
are now at laſt ſcarce in a Condition, by virtue of ſuch Arbitrary
Extravagancies, to defend themſelves. The Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who are
ſo Abſolute, only betray their own Weakneſs by it. And though
<hi>France</hi> at preſent may ſeem to flouriſh outwardly, yet who knows
not that She groans in her Bowels? Indeed Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotton</hi> is
unhappily miſtaken in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion touching <hi>England;</hi>
               <q>That it cannot groan under a Democracy, which it never yet felt
or fear'd:</q> And the late Times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt,
ſeem to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the contrary, and an Exception to that Rule: But
then the Reaſons are given by him but juſt before; <hi>viz.</hi> That
ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſuiting thus with Monarchy, muſt ſtrictly maintain
its Form: And I doubt 'twas ſomething like affecting at Arbitrary Power,
excluſive of his Parliament, at leaſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61249:12"/> the Houſe of Commons, which brought that
Unfortunate Monarch within the Exception to the Rule; and the Rule may ſtand
good ſtill. Generally ſpeaking, Trick and Fraud ſeldom make a Second
Advantage; and <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> after all his Noiſe, inſtances on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, who (he ſays) thriv'd by it; yet mark the End;
he at laſt was poyſon'd by a Fraud prepared by his Baſtard
<hi>Borgia</hi> for another. The <hi>French</hi> have a Saying, <hi>L'
Addreſſe ſurmonte la Force:</hi> But I ſuppoſe they are not ſo
harden'd to extend this to all Frauds and Falſifications: There are ſome
Honeſt Politicks and Stratagems, which a Man of Honour may lawfully uſe, no
doubt, in War, in Peace, in Treaties: Honeſt, if only that Cuſtom hath
given them a ſort of Sanction: Though, by the by, of old theſe Methods were
deſpiſed by the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Heroes, even before Chriſtianity; which allows us
to be <hi>Wiſe as Serpents,</hi> but <hi>Innocent as Doves.</hi> But all that
I contend for in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Politicks, is the Exerciſe of Juſtice and Honour,
which is, or ought to be the Peculiar Character of Kings: And that Sincerity is
the likelieſt Principle to eſtabliſh a Nation: And muſt hold with
<hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> That open Honeſty and Plain-dealing at laſt will
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt Trick and Artifice.</p>
            <p>All Laws of Power are, or are ſuppoſed to be, founded on the
Law of God; and 'tis ſaid, Righteouſneſs ſupports Crowns: For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61249:13"/> God's ſake, What is the Moral of
Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? What is the End of this Abſolute Power? Whence do Kings derive
this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Talent of controuling Mankind? Is it that they have been
ſtiled and courted as Gods, or their Repreſentatives? Alas! we find they
repreſent Man in Underſtanding and Failings: 'Tis not therefore that they
are inſpired with any greater Degree of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Wiſdom: No, we find
by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they are in this like other Men, ſubject to the ſame
Paſſions and Infirmities: As King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt ſaid, They
differ not in Stuff: Their Natural Advantages do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them ſuch
Superiority and Pre-eminence in Power, with any Juſtice of Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This great Deference and Submiſſion which they claim as due to their
Character, muſt be either, That God once vouchſafed them his Supernatural
Aſſiſtance; or, That now Kings are preſumed to have the
Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Better and Wiſer Council. If the firſt, the Signs
are vaniſhed; if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'tis confeſs'd due, ſubject to the Rules
and Forms of the General Law of Nations, and the Municipal Laws of the Land; on
ſuppoſition that Kings act and labour by the joint Concurrence of Wiſe
and Legal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels for the Publick Good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Hence it is that
they are endow'd with greater Privilege; Hence it is that they are intitled to
(what is call'd) Prerogative, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61249:13"/> paſs over the Definitions given by
<hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Britton,</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue</hi>'s fooliſh
Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. There muſt be a Prerogative ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in all Places. There is
a Prerogative in Kings by the Law of Nations; and the Uſe of it is to ſhew
Mercy, to reward Virtue: 'Tis the Law that puniſheth, not Kings; and
becauſe there is no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Equity in Criminal or Capital Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
therefore the Seat of Mercy is placed by the Fountain of Juſtice. This is, no
doubt, properly and truly to be God's Vicegerent. Thus with us, <hi>Poteſt
Rex ei, lege ſuâ Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi>
               <note place="margin">Spelman Gloſſ. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogativa Regis.</note>
               <hi>Condonare, ſi velit, Mortem promeritam:</hi> Spoken of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Confeſſor. Though there is a ſort of Equity by the Letter of our Law
in the Caſe of Manſlaughter, making an allowance for the Paſſions of
Men; and the King's Pardon of Murder hath been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd; it looks like a
Diſpenſing with the Poſitive Law of God: It is certain he can't change
the Puniſhment. There are ſeveral Prerogatives and Flowers of the Crown,
ſome of Uſe, ſome for Ornament, but founded alſo upon Reaſon. The
King hath all Mines of Gold and Silver, <hi>Treaſure Trove,</hi> Eſcheats
of all Cities: May take his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors into Protection, till he be ſatisfied
with Preference: May take Body, Lands, and Goods of Debtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
becauſe the King's Treaſure is ſuppoſed to be for the publick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
May make any Foreign Coin lawful
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61249:14"/> Money of <hi>England</hi> by Proclamation; for
Exigencies may require it. The King may dig in the Subjects Houſe (not
Manſion-Houſe or Barn) for Salt-petre, being for the Defence of the Nation.
Kings only can have Parks and Chaces, and not Subjects, without his Licenſe:
So Swans in Royal Rivers, becauſe they are ſtately Creatures, and Royal
Game, and become the Honour of a King. The King ſhall be ſaid to be
Founder, though another join in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe
'tis for his Honour. The King ſhall have Ward, though the Lands were held of
him by Poſteriority, becauſe the King's Title ſhall be preferr'd, and not
put in Competition with the Subject. So he ſhall not be Tenant in common;
<hi>i. e.</hi> He ſhall have all, becauſe a Subject ought not to be equal
with him in any thing. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeveral other Franchiſes which by
the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of our Law belong to the Crown: And we ſay in our Law, That the
King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and comprehended
within the ſame. We ſay alſo, That the King hath no Prerogative but that
which the Law of the Land allows him: And 'tis certain he is reſtrained in
ſeveral reſpects by our Law, as in a Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: Letting paſs
thoſe Diſtinctions and Cant in <hi>Coke</hi>'s 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Rep. Calvin</hi>'s
Caſe of the King's Prerogative. As he hath Advantages, ſo he hath his
Diſadvantages alſo; at leaſt, Kings,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61249:14"/> or others for them, are apt to call them ſo.
Thus he can't by Teſtament diſpoſe of the Jewels of the Crown; 'tis
doubted whether he may legally pawn them, though it be ſaid he may give them
by his Letters-Patents; 'tis againſt the Honour of the Crown: The Law is ſo
jealous of the King's Honour, that it hath preferr'd it before his Profit. He
hath no Prerogative againſt <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take or prejudice
the Inheritance of any: Can't ſend any man out of the Realm againſt his
Will, becauſe he hath the Command of the Service of the Subjects only for
Defence of the Realm: Can't lay any new Impoſt on Merchandiſes. Can take
none but uſual and Ancient Aids and Taxes. Can't diſpenſe with Statutes
made for Publick Good, or againſt <hi>Nuſances,</hi> or <hi>Mala in
ſe;</hi> Can do no Wrong; Can't alter the Law, Common or Eccleſiaſtical;
Nor Statute-Law, or Cuſtom of the Realm, by Proclamation or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: Nor
create any Offence thereby, which was not an Offence before. Can't grant a
Corporation any new Juriſdiction to proceed by Civil Law, becauſe it may
deprive Subjects hereby of Privilege of Trial. The King can't put off the
Offices of Juſtice of a King; is not ſuppos'd to be ill-affected, but
deceiv'd, and impos'd upon, and abus'd: <hi>Eadem preſumitur mens Regis, quae
eſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61249:15"/> But the late Sticklers for Arbitrary Power
have found out a Plea for the Abſoluteneſs of Kings, which as they think,
carries ſome Face of an Objection againſt the fettering their Prerogative:
Say they, At this rate a King can never exert himſelf as he ought, to do any
Glorious Action; or as King <hi>James</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> phras'd it, to <hi>Carry
the Reputation of a Kingdom high in the World:</hi> He cannot extend his
Conqueſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can or not: Neither can he
oppreſs his Subjects: It is ſufficient for Kings (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for a King
of <hi>Great Britain)</hi> to be on the Defenſive by Land, neither do I
believe any of our Kings ever got any thing by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Dominions. 'Tis
no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us in our Situation, if the matter were ſo: But this Notion
is a Miſtake: For never did any King do extraordinary Feats, where he made
War, and carried it on againſt the Inclinations, or without the Conſent of
his People: The Fights with the <hi>Dutch</hi> at Sea, in the Reign of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, is a ſufficient Inſtance of this Nature: We
fought againſt the Grain, and without an Enemy, as Sir <hi>William
Temple</hi> obſerves. Nor ſhall we find in Hiſtory, that any King hath
continued his enlarged Bounds, where he carried on Impoſts and Taxes by
Violence at Home, to the Impoveriſhing of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let the End of this
preſent <hi>French</hi> King be obſerv'd, who ſeems to ſtand an
Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61249:15"/> at preſent, but he ſtands a very
tickliſh one. Beſides, the true Intereſt and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Iſland
lies another way: To maintain the Sovereignty of the Seas; to promote Trade and
Traffick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to this purpoſe the King hath the higheſt
Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative in this Element: He may preſs Men for this Service, which he
cannot for any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Expedition by Land: He hath Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Tunnage and
Poundage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet not theſe without Conſent in Parliament; and
ſome of our Kings have made but a ſcurvy Experiment, in attempting to take
them without it. Whence then doth come this Title to Arbitrary Abſolute
Power? It muſt be the Child of Conqueſt, or ſome other Paramount Inherent
Right. And to this purpoſe it is objected, That by our Laws we acknowledge
ſeveral Rights and Privileges of the Subject to be Conceſſions from
Kings; and we yield the Lands to be holden imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or mediately of the
Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is pretended to ſound in Conqueſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than
Compact, or to be founded on the Patriarchal Right: And Sir <hi>Robert
Filmer</hi> eſpecially is pleaſant upon Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> for this:
He ſays,
<q>If the firſt Kings were choſen by the People (as many think
they were), then ſurely our Forefathers were a very bountiful (if not
prodigal) People, to give all the Lands of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to their Kings,
with liberty to them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61249:16"/> to keep what they pleas'd, and to give the
Remainder to their Subjects, clogg'd and incumbred with a Condition to defend
the Realm: This is but an ill ſign of a Limited Monarchy by Original
Conſtitution or Contract.</q> At this rate a Man who writes with the Fancy of
a Government, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing, even himſelf. But why doth this
neceſſarily follow? May not ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Privileges and Powers be lodged in
the Crown, for Conformity and Dignity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by Conſent? And ſo,
May not Eſtates, or the Lands of a Kingdom, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by Contract, with the
acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tenure, and to expreſs the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? How come Lands to
Eſcheat to the Crown, (for they are forfeited for Treaſon) I mean of
Cities, but that there is no Heir? How comes the King to have the Year, Day,
and Waſte of Lands, which Eſcheat to the Lord? By what Law, if not of
Contract? To ſay they moved from the King, and were Limitations of his
Bounty, is as much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on the other hand, and <hi>gratis dictum.</hi>
If he had virtually all Lands, Why not all Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too? No man
will ſay that. If he had, I confeſs there would be then no uſe of
Parliaments. But to proceed, the King by his Prerogative may Call, and
Prorogue, and Diſſolve Parliaments: By what Law had he this Prerogative? If
not by Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and Conſent, of Neceſſity to avoid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61249:16"/> Confuſion; for if he could Command his
Subjects Purſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be any
Original uſe of them: He might, and would, no doubt, have call'd and made
uſe of only a Privy, or Cabinet Council, or Cabal; for after this way of
Inference, no King would certainly have Clogg'd himſelf with the impertinent
Formalities of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their Predeceſſors were very Weak, or
Prodigal to Clip their own Wings, and give their Subjects a ſhare in the
Legiſlative Power: This is but an ill ſign of an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Abſolute,
Arbitrary Power: And 'twas upon this pretence, though thoſe Gentlemen don't
care to own it, That they would have endeavoured to Diſengage their King from
the uſe of Parliaments, and would conclude, That the King might chuſe,
whether he would ever call any or not, at leaſt in this Form. Thus they would
beg the Queſtion, and preſume the Conſequence on their ſide; becauſe
equally abſurd. The King may Proclaim War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Does it follow
therefore that he may make it without other Heads and Hands? Thus they confound
the Executive and Legiſlative Authority. They ſay Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a ſign of
a Licentious Age, and ſome think of a Decaying State too: Ought not ſome
Creaturs to be Muzled? There were many odd ſort of extravagant Books
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on Subjects of this Nature, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; not without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61249:17"/> Reaſon, as we may ſuppoſe: But all
theſe violent purſuits in both Extremes, are ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and where all
Parties mean nothing but the Publick Good, there's nothing of this nature worth
contending for. And whoever will reflect on the Circumſtances, and
Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Times of ſuch Publications, and the advancing theſe
high-flown Notions, with a little pains of Compariſon, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee
through the Myſtery of their Policy.</p>
            <p>It is very extraordinary, That Subjects make Kings Conquerors in
ſpight of their Teeths, and againſt their own Profeſſions and
Declarations, on purpoſe to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Slaves by their own
Conſequence; though this really is neither the true Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nor
Import, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spelman</hi> makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Gloſſary; let them
take it in their own ſenſe; but we may aſſure our ſelves they did not
intend to inſlave themſelves. They tell us, That <hi>William</hi> the
I<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> was a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and therefore we were all Slaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(though at other times Force and Succeſs will make no Right): Yet afterwards
they alſo tell us, when we come to inſiſt on our Rights as Subjects, That
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> was obtained by Force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then? So had
the Crown been before. (it ſeems) by them: Either the People of
<hi>England</hi> had ſome Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights before the Conqueſt, or not: If
they had (as is confeſs'd), 'twas time to endeavour the Reſtoring of them.
If <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61249:17"/> the I<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> were an Intruder, and came in by
Force of Arms only, he was but a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Uſurper; and the People being
under a Force, could not loſe their Rights: If he came in with pretence of
Title, Title conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued them in their Rights; and either way was juſtifiable.
I am engaged in this matter before I am aware, and beyond my firſt
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and I ſhall meet with theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men anon. But not to
foreſtal you in the Hiſtory, I can't avoid a Hint upon thoſe times, being
upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and that being by that Act declared to be
Declarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Fundamental Rights and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of the Realm: To ſhew
the Arts of Debauching Kings, and the end of ſuch Attempts, in one previous
Inſtance;
<q>
                  <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> (as you may ſee in Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coke</hi>'s <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Magna Charta, &amp;c.)</hi> meaning to make
his ſtep to Ambition, (which ever Rideth without Reins) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded and
humoured that King, That he might avoid that Charter of his Father King
<hi>John,</hi> by <hi>Dureſs,</hi> and his own great Charter, and <hi>Charta
de Foreſta</hi> alſo, for that he was within Age; whereupon the King got
one of the great Charters, and that of the Foreſt into his Hands, and by his
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel unjuſtly <hi>Cancell'd</hi> both the ſaid Charters; though this
<hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> was <hi>Primier</hi> Witneſs of all the Temporal
Lords to both the ſaid Charters; whereupon he became
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61249:18"/> in high Favour with the King,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſoon after (for Flattery, and Flatterers have no ſure
Foundation) he fell into the King's heavy Indignation; and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fearful
and miſerable Troubles, he was Juſtly, and according to Law, Sentenc'd by
his Peers in open Parliament, and as juſtly Degraded of the Dignity which he
had unjuſtly obtained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that other Notion of Paternal Right is as Extraordinary: This
takes a ſhort way, and makes Mankind Rebels from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or from the
Flood. Who could have imagined, That this Paternal Dominion from <hi>Adam</hi>
could have been inferr'd from that Expreſſion of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The
earth hath he given to the children of men?</hi> Which Sir <hi>Robert
Filmer</hi> (learnedly) ſays, <hi>Doth ſhew that the Title of Government
comes from Fatherhood.</hi> Methinks it ſeems a more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and literal
Argument to Exclude Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (or to lay them aſide, as they do in ſome
Countries, at ſuch an Age): Why have not this Party a ſcruple of
Conſcience about all other Variations of Government, even by God himſelf?
At this rate they ought to procure Maſſes for the Souls of their
Progenitors who lived in the Heptarchy: It is certain, no body living under any
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth can hope to be Saved, as remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a continued ſtate of
Rebellion. Thus they create a double Obligation on Men, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61249:18"/> harraſs their very Souls between their
Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Political Parents, in virtue of the Fifth Commandment: But as much
a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> as he ſeems to be, I know not how he will excuſe
<hi>Pharamond</hi> for introducing the <hi>Salique Law,</hi> nor the Nobleſs
of the Country for encouraging it; for the Commandment ſays, <hi>Honour thy
Mother</hi> alſo. I hope Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Filmer</hi> had no Gavelkind Land;
the Cuſtom of Taneſtry and Borough<hi>-Engliſh,</hi> muſt alſo be
abominable in his ſight; which to other Men ſeem to be built upon good
natural Principles of Reaſon. But (ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) what indifferent Perſon
(if there can be any ſuch in the World) will, without indignation, digeſt
ſuch ſort of Debates? After the ſame faſhion Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>
gives us farther to underſtand;
<q>He cannot learn, That either the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or
<hi>Latin,</hi> have any proper Original Word for a <hi>Tyrant</hi> or
<hi>Slave;</hi> it ſeems theſe are of late invention, and taken up in
Diſgrace of Monarchical Government.</q> Why not more Charitably, as well as
more truly, from the Experience of the Abuſes in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſuch
Monarchical, or Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? And he himſelf had given the reaſon but
juſt before, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors liv'd in
Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For which reaſon, no doubt, there was no occaſion for
ſuch Monſtrous and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Terms.</q> But he could not be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61249:19"/> in this Obſervation; I muſt appeal from
his Sincerity, to his Judgment. He does well to bar all other Schemes but his
own:
<q>He forbids us to rely on <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Grand
Maſter of Politicks; or the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Hiſtorians,
who liv'd in Popular Times: </q>Though Monſieur <hi>Rapin</hi> allows
<hi>Ariſtole,</hi> &amp;c. to be us'd in Divinity, and ſays, St.
<hi>Thomas,</hi> and other Divines, have us'd him with good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But others, and they Divines and Biſhops too, have lately told
us, That we are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Scripture in ſuch Caſes. In what a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is poor Subject Man? And what was all this to the purpoſe? when
Scripture it ſelf doth not peremptorily conclude us, but leaves us at large
to the Laws and Uſages of Countries, to the Ordinances of Man, as Sir
<hi>Robert</hi> himſelf confeſſes, though with a lamentable ſtrain upon
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Every one ſaw what was aim'd at,
and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by way of deduction from thoſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks of Doctrinal Government:
But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sir <hi>Robert</hi> ſends us to <hi>France</hi> to School to
be inform'd in our Conſtitution, and very much affects <hi>French</hi> Policy
(for he wrote in a time when the <hi>French</hi> Air was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant); let us
ſee whether the Kings of <hi>France</hi> themſelves did always talk in this
Language: Whether they have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſo uniform in this Fancy of
Abſolute Power, for the diſpoſing of themſelves, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61249:19"/> their Kingdoms: <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt
(who was Contemporary with our <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and as Haughty a
Prince, and was attended with the Flattery of Courtiers too) when he was taken
Priſoner at the Battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for Anſwer to the
Propoſals ſent him by the Emperor for his Releaſe, amongſt other
things, ſays,
<q>That they were not in his power, becauſe they ſhock'd the
Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of <hi>France,</hi> to which he was ſubjected,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> After he was at liberty, having call'd an Aſſembly of the
moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Perſons of the Three Eſtates of the Kingdom for their
Advice touching the delivery of his Children and himſelf, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to
return to Priſon, if they thought fit; Their <hi>Orders</hi> all anſwer'd
ſeparately, That his Perſon was the Kingdom's, not his; and as touching the
reſtoring of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> That it was a Member of the Crown, whereof
he was but Uſufructua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; That therefore he could not diſpoſe of the one
or t'other. But withal they offer'd him Two Millions of Gold for the Ranſom
of his Children, and aſſur'd him, That if it muſt come to a War, they
would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpare their Lives nor Fortunes.</q> I'm
<note place="margin">Mez. <hi>Chron.</hi> 587.</note> ſorry no
Precedent will ſerve for our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only that of the preſent
<hi>French</hi> King, and his Ally the <hi>Great Turk:</hi> In the ſenſe of
theſe Authors, theirs muſt be the only Apoſtolick Orthodox Inſtitution.
We
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61249:20"/> are told alſo, That there is a Place, where,
whenever the King ſpits, the greateſt Ladies of his Court put out their
Hands to receive it: And another Nation, where the moſt Eminent Perſons
about him ſtoop to take up his Ordure in a Linnen Cloth: And other People,
where no Subject ſpeaks to the King, but through a Trunk; and there are, no
doubt, ſeveral other ſuch like Fantaſtick Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Submiſſion,
and Idolatrous. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: What then? Every Land is ſtill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to
be guided by its own Cuſtoms and Laws: And I wiſh ſome of theſe
Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Arbitrary-Power-Sparks liv'd in one of the laſt mention'd Places.
In earneſt, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is a moſt ſordid and pernicious Vice, and we were
lately very near drawing down Judgments on our ſelves for it; and had like to
have ſuffer'd for pretending to offer Sacrifices which were never meant. This
Stuff of Paſſive Submiſſion to Arbitrary Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Powers, could
never be offer'd to ſale in a true Light: The Doctrine would ſtink in the
Noſtrils of a Good King, who had any thing of Virtue, Piety, or good Nature:
A King, who, to uſe the words of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt,
<q>Acknowledges himſelf <hi>ordain'd for his People,</hi> having
received from God a Burthen of Government, whereof he muſt be Accountable;
and a good King thinketh his higheſt Honour to conſiſt in the due
Diſcharge of his Calling; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61249:20"/> all his ſtudy and pains to procure; and
maintain, by the making and executing of Good Laws, the Welfare and Peace of
his People; and as the Natural Father and kindly Maſter thinketh his
greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment ſtandeth in their Proſperity, and his greateſt
Surety in having their Hearts.</q> This, as to the Political and Moral part of
Government. And as to the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: What is it but to inſpire a
King with Perſecution? What muſt this come to, when Kings have different
Educations, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tutors to catechize them, if the Civil
Eſtabliſhment be not our Standard, and the Law our Protection in Church as
well as State? As to the Caſe where the King and the Laws are of the ſame
perſuaſion, If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants and Diſſenters are ſo unfortunate as to
fall under a Proſecution for their particular Opinions, be it at the peril of
the King's Conſcience, and thoſe who adviſe him; but here, and here only
is the true Notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſive; and I muſt confeſs I can't tell
how to help them: Here I think they muſt ſuffer, and not reſiſt, but
fly to another City, if they do not like that where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment legally
ſits upon their Skirts. Though I know ſome don't allow the Legiſlative
Power to intermeddle with Religion, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much a Lay mixture for the
Pallet of the Church; Yet, for my part, I do not ſee how otherwiſe we could
maintain any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61249:21"/> Eſtabliſhment in it: For though ſince
the Reformation, the King, as Head, hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy devolv'd on him, and
'tis conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he may make Canons to bind the Clergy even without a
Convocation; yet as the Church does not allow him to ſpeak with his own
Mouth, or Act with his own Hands in the Adminiſtration of Eſſentials of
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo the State doth not in the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them: So that he is
not Abſolute or Independent either in his Eccleſiaſtical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Capacity of Policy: And therefore the whole Conſtitution, and Three
Eſtates, muſt neceſſarily be call'd in on all Occaſions of Change in
Diſcipline, or Innovation of Rites, as well as in the alteration and
repealing of other Old Laws, or introducing and declaring New ones. This by way
of Parentheſis; But I was ſpeaking of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s
Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Power, and the Extravagancies he infers from thence, grounded, as
he pretends, from Scripture. Therefore I would only ask him one Queſtion
more: Was there no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Word in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or
<hi>Latin,</hi> for Tyrant, or Slave? Pray how then came the Words and Doctrine
of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> into the
<hi>Greek?</hi> It muſt be only taken up of late by ſome ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
in diſgrace of Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to Law; and to put
Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as Legal, out of countenance; To bring People to ſubmit blindly
to <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61249:21"/> There is the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
<hi>Greek,</hi> which ſignifies at leaſt, <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince:</hi>
But is there any one doubts, that there has been ſuch a thing as a Harſh,
Unreaſonable, and Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father or King? It muſt follow then, that the
Obedience intended by the Apoſtles (who wrote in <hi>Greek)</hi> was only to
the Laws, and the Legal Exerciſe of them, according to the Uſage of their
reſpective Places, which made them Legal: Or to Kings, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a terror
to the Good, but only to the Evil: But it would tire even Patience it ſelf to
follow theſe ſort of Gentlemen in all their Confuſed By-ways. Therefore
to return more immediately to my Subject, and to my Friend <hi>Seigneur de
Montaigne,</hi> whom I am not aſham'd to own, let the Grave and Wiſe ſay
what they will; for I muſt ever have a greater Reſpect for an Author who
talks judiciouſly of Trifling Matters (if they be ſo), than for One who
talks triflingly on Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Subjects. He tells us,
<q>Theſe Great and Tedious Debates about the beſt Form of
Society, and the moſt Commodious Rules to bind us, are Debates only proper
for the Exerciſe of our Wits; and all the Deſcriptions of Policies, feign'd
by Art, are found to be ridiculous, and unfit to be put in practice. And in
another place, Not according to Opinion, but in Truth and Reality, The beſt
and moſt Excellent Government for every Nation, is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61249:22"/> which it is maintain'd: </q>This
<hi>Montaigne</hi> ſays, who expreſs'd and practis'd as great Loyalty as
ever any Man of Senſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did; and I agree with him,
<q>That all Reverence and Submiſſion is due to Kings, except
that of the Underſtanding.</q>This as a Gentleman; and as a Chriſtian, he
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds,
<q>Chriſtian Religion hath all the Marks of utmoſt Utility and
Juſtice, but none more manifeſt than the ſevere Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it lays
indifferently upon all, to yield abſolute Obedience to the Civil
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and to maintain and defend the Laws: </q>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> in
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> To ſubmit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law. And all Policy, as well as
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, enforces Obedience to the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Right and Juſtice:
And if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to argue from Etymologies (which is ſurer than from
Examples) the <hi>Grecians</hi> tell us the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

build Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of
them was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by certain Laws. But we ſhall never have done,
never come to any ſettlement, if the Forms of Government and Laws are not
admitted, but ſuffer'd to be diſputed at this time of day. We are therefore
to take Laws as we find them, and as they ſtand in uſe and practice by a
continued Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It can't be material therefore to look
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61249:22"/> back how the Figure of our Legiſlative Power
ſtood a Thouſand Years ago, or from a much ſhorter date of Time; How the
Form of Writs, iſſued to the Commons, was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: (though, no doubt,
the beſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is with them, and it is confeſt they were always a
Conſtituent part of the Legiſlative Power); as 'tis idle and impertinent to
ſay, The Supreme or Legiſlative Power muſt be ever Arbitrary; this is an
abſurd Affirmation, when all Parties in a Nation agree by their
Repreſentatives to the Enaction of Laws. By the Laws of God and Man, Our
Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ought now to reſt in Peace in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Eſtabliſhment: Kings ſwear, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> preach'd in the
Mount, to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: A King's Coronation-Oath muſt be interpreted,
<hi>ad Captum Populi,</hi> and to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Intendment; That ſo there may be
ſome certain Rule of Governing, and true Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Obeying, whereby the
whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity may be preſerv'd in Peace and Order, which is the End of all
Government.</p>
            <p>We in <hi>England</hi> ſeem to value our ſelves more
peculiarly on the Polity of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: There hath been enough ſaid
in praiſe of our Laws: No doubt they are very good, if well obſerv'd; ſo
good at leaſt, That I never heard that any King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ever
pretended to except againſt them, when he was ask't the Queſtion at his
Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61249:23"/> Whether he would Obſerve the Laws? and ſo
Good, That the Subject (as far as I perceive) deſires only the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Continuance of them. And I will be bold to ſay, for the Honour of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation and People, (notwithſtanding the ill Name ſome
are pleas'd to give us at home and abroad at preſent) That there was never
any War in <hi>England,</hi> from the <hi>Barons</hi> War to the late <hi>Civil
War,</hi> (ſetting aſide the Diſpute between the H. of <hi>Y.</hi> and
<hi>L.)</hi> but what was occaſion'd and begun on Colour of the King's
impoſing an Arbitrary Power over the Rights and Privileges of the People, and
after Complaint and Application for Redreſs of Grievances, and Reſtitution
of their Rights and Privileges; and all other Nations have done the ſame
where they could; (I ſpeak of the beginning of Wars, I do not always
juſtify the End of them); And muſt aver, That the People of
<hi>England</hi> in general, have, notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which is
Exotick, been always Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd Subjects: Eaſy enough to be impos'd upon,
and cajoled out of their Money, and their Lives, for the Service of the Crown;
And, as I think, ſo Modeſt, that they have never aſſum'd, as Men, to
ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Majeſty, nor have ever pretended to be ſo much
as Kings, till Kings were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to think themſelves more than Men,
Hence, as you will perceive, in theſe ſhort
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61249:23"/> following Remarks, have (for the moſt part)
ſprung thoſe Jealouſies which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded King and People, and disjointed
the United Common Intereſt of Both. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and Deſigning Men have
rais'd Fantoms of Powers and Laws, which had being only in the Clouds, at
leaſt had none amongſt us: And Imaginary Conſtructions have been put upon
thoſe, which were plain and obvious. The Terms of <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>Subjection</hi> have been ſo artificially debated, and the Laws of God
and Nature, the Law of Reaſon, and that of Nations, ſo partially and
ſlily, as well as learnedly confounded, that the true Idea of our own
Government and Law was perplex'd and loſt. So that no wonder if Miſtaken
Principles ſometimes miſled King and People, where they might mean well
enough both; and at other times either King or People might have a latitude of
conſtruing them perverſely, when they did not ſo.</p>
            <p>Now though 'tis confeſs'd we cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any degree of
Perfection in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (nor any thing elſe) here in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
uncertain World; Yet Experience convinceth us, That ſome Times have been
better than others; and that this Nation hath been happier under ſome Princes
than Others, <hi>i. e.</hi> happier under thoſe whoſe Conduct and
Government have agreed beſt with the Laws and Conſtitutions. The only
Deſign of theſe paſſing-Obſervations and Reflections, is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61249:24"/> to point out the Errors, and ſet a Mark on
the Rocks, that we may avoid them: To ſhew Kings and People the Principles
and Practiſes by which they Miſcarried or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, upon Rational
Grounds, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequences; ſo that Meaſures may be taken which
may more probably ſecure the Peace and Welfare of this Nation for the
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I go no farther back than the Conqueſt or Deſcent here by King
<hi>William</hi> the Firſt; That being (as I think) enough for our
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; enough to Inform, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding our Memories and

<hi>William the Conqueror</hi> (as they call him) in the uſual Acceptation,

Laws, and introduced the <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but the Alteration ſeems
to be for

which, for ought I know, his Two Sons and Nephew might come to untimely Ends in

               <p>DURING this King's Time, the Government and Laws ſeem to be in
a continued Ferment and State of War. As he was attack'd on all Hands, and put
to great Charges, ſo he ſpared neither Church nor State for Taxations, but
pillaged both in an unreaſonable extravagant manner. It is ſaid he doubted
of ſome Points of Religion; but one would rather believe he doubted of it
all, by his Life, and Expreſſion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Management
of Churchmen and their Benefices, and Religious Houſes: He Died ſo
ſuddenly, that he had not time to tell his Opinion at his Death. If he did
not keep his Word ſo devoutly as he ought; if he was trifling in things
appertaining to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and profanely free with the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the
Church, the Hiſtorians of that Age have aſſign'd him the Judgments of God

with-holding <hi>Peter Pence.</hi> In this King's Reign we find the firſt
Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a Prerogative; which ſeems reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and natural enough,
in forbidding his Subjects by Proclamation to go out of the

ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a good Deſign; but being introduced only, firſt to make his
Subjects uneaſy at Home, and after to get Money out of them for a Licenſe
to go Abroad; the Occaſion diſgraceth the Thing, which otherwiſe had been
juſtifiable on a true foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> To require the Service of the
Subject at Home; for the Command of the Aid of the Perſons of his People, is
as much an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Right in the Crown, as any can be in his own Dominions,

               <p>THEY who Write this King's Life, do ſo vary in his Character,
that it is ſomewhat difficult to Adjuſt it: But we always ought to ſpeak
the beſt of Kings, if the matter will any ways bear it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he came to
the Crown with a juſt Title or not, he came with a juſt degree of
Underſtanding and Inclinations to do Juſtice: He was Born of a King in
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Queen of Royal <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood, as Sir <hi>John
Hayward</hi> ſays; though I know not how he makes it out well; and is ſaid
therefore to have raiſed the Depreſſed <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation again
unto Honour and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and took off their Badges of Slavery, and ſeems
truly Endowed with Kingly Principles; though <hi>Cambden</hi> will have it,
That he was Juſt even to a Fault; Pray God That were the only Fault of Kings.
Whatever hath been ſaid to his Diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he appears, for the moſt
part, to have Governed by the Laws of the Land: And as he gave a Meaſure to
others, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made the Laws a Meaſure of his Prerogative. It will not
be worth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61249:27"/> Whether he firſt Inſtituted a
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Form it now ſtands: He rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Money in a Parliamentary
way; we find in his Firſt Parliament at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Three Shillings upon every Hide of Land, towards the Marriage of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the Emperor, although 'tis ſaid there, theſe Aids were due by Common
Law from the King's Tenants by Knight's Service, <hi>viz.</hi> Aid to Ranſom
the King's Perſon; Aid to make the King's Eldeſt Son a Knight, and Aid to
Marry the King's Eldeſt Daughter once. And although this matter was
aſcertain'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter at
<hi>Running-Mead,</hi> yet following Kings have not been ſo tender and
reſerv'd in this Point. If he may be ſaid to be Cruel to his Brother
<hi>Robert,</hi> I'm ſure he was very Honourable towards <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> when in <hi>England,</hi> whither he came on his own Head,
notwithſtanding he was Solicited and Tempted to make him away. As to his
Perſonal Virtues or Vices, they were to himſelf: If he fail'd in the
Oeconomicks, he had Troubles in his own Houſe; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Misfortunes
of this kind were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Judgments, or the Follies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or
Wife, it is certain he had his ſhare of them; but he took ſo much care that
the Nation knew but very few troubles during his Reign. And as he obtained a
Kingdom by a ſort of Artifice, ſo he uſed his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with

Charges that way, yet he required few or no Tributes from the People. 'Tis
ſaid he had another way of getting Money, <hi>viz,</hi> by cauſing Men to
be Impleaded and Fined for Hunting in his Foreſts, after he had given them
Liberty to Hunt there. For thus far, at leaſt, the Kings Exerciſed an

               <p>THOUGH this King came to the Crown by the moſt Abſolute
Title and Cleareſt Right, yet in Four and thirty Years time, we do not find
that he pretended to impoſe upon his People any Arbitrary Power; but by
Succeſs and Policy he added to the Crown of <hi>England, Scotland,
Ireland,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Orcades, Britain, Poytiers, Guyen,</hi> and
other Provinces of <hi>France:</hi> And for all this he had only one Tax of
Eſcuage towards his War with <hi>France.</hi> His cauſing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to
be Demoliſhed, was a juſtifiable piece of Policy, for the reaſon given,
as being Nurſeries of Rebellion. In the beginning of his Reign he refined and
reformed the Laws, and 'tis ſaid, made them more To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and Profitable to
his People than they were before; and, what is better, Governed himſelf by
them. We do not find the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Capital Offences, or others, were
certain, but variable and diſtinguiſhed in the ſame Crime, according to
the degrees of Aggravation. The Church-Chroniclers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a Judgment upon

Cauſe; but they might be miſtaken, and he might (as he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) have
had greater from his own Sons, if he had gone Abroad upon that Errand. And if
the Church will forgive him the Story of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> (for he was
otherwiſe very Civil to it) the State had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him;
for he ſuffered neither his Wars nor his Pleaſures to be Chargeable to the

Parliament, or by the Subjects own Contribution and Method of Charging

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61249:32"/> Beat or Compounded the latter out of the

Treaſury committed to their Care and Government.</p>
               <p>Theſe Indignities put upon the Lords, put them alſo upon

Enſlave the Nation; and, to crown the matter, marries himſelf, without

Policy, it had not, nevertheleſs, the like ſucceſs; at leaſt,
<hi>Scotland</hi> was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to him, that he died there: His War
with <hi>France</hi> was but a Trifle, and ſoon ended in a Truce: His laſt
Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with his Lords was the Effect of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61249:35"/> Unadviſed Obſtinacy on both hands; for
he ought not to have inſiſted on ſending, or their going to the Wars in
<hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his going himſelf in Perſon; and they ought
not to have refuſed going with him in Perſon, though in or out of
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> but yet he made up the Breach by his
ſubſequent Prudence, and ſoft De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour: The worſt Action of his Reign
(to me) ſeems to be Bribing the Pope to abſolve him from the Covenant made
with his Subjects concerning their Charters, which he had confirm'd with an
Oath; but the other good Laws which he made and obſerved, ſhall (with me)
excuſe one Act of Frailty or Paſſion. And if he be cenſured for his
Taxes, he is, in part, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by his well beſtowing them, to his own

               <p>WE are not to expect much good from a King who begins his Reign
with the breach of his Father's Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Obligations he lay under
by him in matters of Duty; Commands which his Father gave him in charge with
his laſt Words, on pain of a Curſe for his Diſobedience, as <hi>Stow</hi>
ſays. And here it may be obſerved, how wretched and contemptible a Creature
(pardon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) even a King (as well as another Man) is, when he
hath once broke looſe from the Principles of Honour and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; when the
Natural Bonds of Modeſty are unhinged and broken: How he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and
ſhuffles, and is driven about by every Wind, that he cannot be ſteady to
himſelf, or any one elſe. When Men have once forſaken the Path of Vertue,
they walk in an endleſs Maze; they can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on themſelves, and therefore
are impos'd upon, and miſled by every one. For when a Man cannot juſtify
himſelf to himſelf, he can never do it to another; and Kings generally
ſtand ſo much upon the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61249:36"/> of being like Gods, that they ſcorn to be
thought to be in the wrong, like Men.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee how fatal 'tis to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a private Perſon,
before the Publick; and for a Prince to eſpouſe the Intereſt of a
Favourite, ſo far as to put him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with all his other Subjects;
and to oppoſe his Welfare to theirs.</p>
               <p>The whole Reign of this Poor King is but one Farce of Folly and
Misfortune; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd by his Subjects, and even by his own Wife, who revenged
upon him the violation of a double Tye of Obedience: This was the immediate, as
well as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequence, of relying upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Advice of
ſingle Perſons, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Counſels, and againſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of
the Wiſdom of the Nation. After Troubles on the behalf of
<hi>Gaveſton;</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a faint ill-managed
War; Troubles on account of the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;</hi> Troubles in his own Family,
(for he was no wiſer in his Oeconomicks than his Politicks) with his Wife,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was at laſt ſhamefully Depoſed, barbarouſly Uſed,
and villanouſly Murther'd. A Perſon in his Natural Capacity certainly to be
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as having ſome Virtues and Good Qualities: Fit to make an
Accompliſh't Gentleman, though not a Good King.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61249:36"/> Kingly Government did not ſeem to be his
Talent, for he lived as if born for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not for others; and there is
certainly a difference in the Quality of governing a Man's ſelf and others,
between governing and being govern'd. To this purpoſe I muſt bring in
<hi>Montaign,</hi> who ſeems to have a good Notion of the Thing.
<q>Doubtleſs, ſays he, it can be no eaſy Task to Rule
others, when we find it ſo hard a matter to govern our ſelves: And as to
the Thing Dominion, which ſeems ſo charming, the Frailty of Human Wiſdom,
and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in Choice of Things that are New, and Doubtful to us,
conſider'd, I'm very much of Opinion, That it is far more pleaſant to
follow, than to lead; and that it is a great Settlement and Satisfaction of
Mind, to have only one Path to walk in, and to have none to anſwer for but a
Man's ſelf: For without doubt (ſays he) there is a great and painful Duty
incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon a Good King: How much doth it import Kings to have a Good
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Counſel?</q> For, I doubt we ſhall find but few Kings (whether
of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's making, or our own, <hi>i. e.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Inheritance
<hi>(Solus Deus facit haeredes)</hi> or Election) of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s
Qualifications, who ſays, <hi>That no Man is fit to Rule, but he who in his

               <p>THE Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was more a School of Arms
than Civil Polity: For having in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning patch'd up an Indifferent Peace

he has his weak Side in the Buſineſs of <hi>Alice Peirce</hi> his

But when he was at leiſure he made Good Laws, and particularly in the Affair

               <p>SOME Princes have Erred upon a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Conſideration,

Meaſures by Advice of Friends (as they thought) and have been deceived by
Miſrepreſentations; (theſe may be pittied); Others have Miſcarried by
hearkening on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Minions and Favourites, are head-ſtrong, and reſolvedly
deaf and obſtinate againſt Advice: But the Actions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this
King are ſo Unaccountable, that it would puzzle a <hi>Matchiavel</hi> to
aſſign him a Character, or to fix him in any Rule or Principle of
Government, Good or Bad. The Rebellion of <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi>
ought not to be laid at his Door; it is called an Accident, though it had
ſome diſmal Effects in it; but the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which appears, was the
Abuſe of a Collector who gathered the Poll-Money; yet it may teach Kings,
that it is a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and dangerous Experiment to let out a Revenue or Tax
to Farm; ſo that it may be ſcrued up into what may be called in the Country
Oppreſſion. This King's firſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61249:38"/> Miſunderſtanding, in earneſt, or
Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, if I may ſo ſpeak, after his coming to Age, was impoſed
upon him by way of Surpriſe, and Artificial Inſinuation of Favourites; it
might be the reſult of a hot Indiſcretion, not of a premeditated Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or Invaſion of Ill-natur'd Policy: And if the Duke of <hi>Ireland, Michael de
la Pool,</hi> the Chancellor, or the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> were in
fault on the one ſide, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> &amp;c. to be altogether excuſed, on the other;
and the Parliament impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the King Thirteen Lords to have overſight
under the King, as they called it, was an unſufferable Encroachment on the
Spirit of a Young Prince: And he had reaſon to have recourſe to the Judges
for their Opinions and Directions touching what had paſſed in that
Parliament as to their Participation of the Government with him; whoſe
Opinion (though they had the misfortune to ſuffer for it) was not ſo
Illegal, but Juſtifiable by the Laws, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only in Two or Three of the
Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to which they gave their Anſwers. But Law is not always
meaſured by its own Rule, it ſtands or falls accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
Circumſtance of Times: A Man may at ſome time ſooner and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Steal a
Horſe (as they ſay) than look on at others. This firſt Affront ſo put
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61249:39"/> upon the King, gave him a prejudice to
Parliaments ever after, and conſequently put him upon indirect Means and
Practices to Debauch the Conſtitution; and we may be ſure Kings will never
want Tools fit for their purpoſe. Hence were conceived thoſe prejudices
alſo againſt the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and the other Lords; the King
had Reaſon to be out of Tuition when he came to be of full Age: 'Tis true,
the Attempting of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s Life in that Treacherous
manner, was not to be excuſed; neither was his Behaviour to be pardoned
towards the King; he reproached him too ſeverely on all Occaſions, for
though he was the King's Uncle, he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be his Governor; they
were both in Fault, no doubt, and both equally Unfortunate in their End. 'Twas
an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Reign, divided between too haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Subjects, and Ill-deſigning
Favourites, too powerful for a Young Inconſiderate King to Manage with
Prudence and equal Power. Whether Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſilian</hi> did
according to Law or not, 'tis certain his Death was not according to Law; and
as the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> had taken his Life, ſo his own was ſoon
after taken away without Trial alſo, in an Arbitrary manner: And the Earl of
<hi>Arundel</hi> had the ſame Meaſure he meeted to <hi>Calvery,</hi> one of
the Queens Eſquires. The Baniſhing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61249:39"/> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and
<hi>Hereford,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was rather a
fault in the Politicks of thoſe times (for it ſeems it was the Cuſtom
then to Puniſh the Faults of Great Men only with Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an
ill-adviſed Cuſtom,) than want of Conſideration in the King. Sir <hi>John
Buſhy,</hi> the Speaker of Parliament, was the moſt in fault, in
attributing Vain, and almoſt Blaſphemous Titles to the King; Titles fitter
(as is obſerved) for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God; and putting him upon a piece of
Omnipotence, in Recalling his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; which the Lords, Spiritual and
Temporal, Adjudged in the Affirmative, That the King might Revoke; but the
Lawyers and Judges, having been burnt before, deſigned to give Judgment
t'other way, and had no mind to Determine of Tranſactions in Parliament any
more, nor of the Kings Prerogative in ſuch Tickliſh Times: Though at the
next Parliament at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Judges were drawn in to give another
Extraordinary Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q> That when Articles are propounded by the King to be handled
in Parliament, that if other Articles are handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe are
determined, it is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them that do it.</q> What was there Extravagant
that was not done in this Parliament? He brought it about, as the Hiſtory
ſays, That he obtained the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61249:40"/> whole Power of the Parliament to be
Conferred upon certain few Perſons; who proceeded to Conclude upon many
things which concerned generally the things of the whole Parliament, to the
great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the State, and dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in time to come. What
could we expect from a King who was Taught, That the Laws of the Realm were in
his Head and his Breaſt? By reaſon of which fantaſtical Opinion, he
Deſtroyed Noblemen, and Impoveriſhed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which was one of the
Articles againſt him; and which was much ſuch a worthy fancy as <hi>Wat
Tyler</hi> had, who putting his Hand to his Lips, ſaid, Before Four Days come
to an End, all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ſhould proceed from his Mouth.
But I am weary of the Medley of this King's Story: In ſhort, if we ſurvey
him in his Taxations, in his Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances after all, and in the Station
of a Chriſtian, and Man, as well as King; we ſhall, with a little Charity,
or good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conclude him Blameable rather by Accident than natural Temper:
And as to his Conditions, That they were more the Fault of his Education than
Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and at the bottom, thoſe Failings that were in him, retained
the tincture of the light Inconſtancy of his Mother. He is another
unfortunate Inſtance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61249:40"/> and Miſery of a King when he leaves the
Track of Law and Juſtice, for the Ways of Humour and Paſſion. Sir

<q>That <hi>Buſhy</hi>'s Contrivance of Compounding with

Confuſion, ſaving only the laſt Year: And 'tis ſaid, he was well
pleaſed that there were always Troubles that there might be no Calm or
Interval for Reflection. He was ſo jealous of his Crown, that in his
Sickneſs he would have it laid by him upon his Bolſter, for fear ſome
body ſhould Diſpoſſeſs him of it, as he had <hi>Richard</hi> the

he was a very Silly Man, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an Innocent; yet this ſilly Innocence
ſeems to be what we call Simplicity in the modeſt acceptation of the word,
and the Effect rather of Choice, or Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Defect. 'Tis true he
had a ſort of Paſſive Underſtanding; but he had Judgment enough to
diſtinguiſh Good and Bad, between Virtue and Vice, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and
Misfortune; to reſent theſe as a Man, but overlook them as a Chriſtian,
and what Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> reports of him upon the account of his
being to be Canonized, (That the Pope, who was jealous of his Honour and of the
Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> knowing that <hi>Henry</hi> the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
was reputed in the World abroad but for a Simple Man, was afraid it would but
diminiſh the Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind of Honour, if there were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61249:43"/> not a diſtance kept between Innocents and
Saints,) ſeems to be brought in rather for the ſake of the Jingle or
Jeſt, than Truth. His greateſt ſymptom of Weakneſs was ſuffering a
Wife to be impoſed upon him, and then being ever after impoſed upon by that
Wife; but I doubt this may have been the condition of ſome Wiſe Men; and
the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> plaid the fool in the Match, not the King, any
otherwiſe than by taking the Advice of a ſingle Perſon, without, and
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Counſel of his Other Peers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what have
Wiſer Kings done, beſet with a Favourite or a Wife? Whereas he had both;
which ſhews, that 'tis not ſo much a King's perſonal and private
Wiſdom, as That of the General Council of a Nation, is to be relied on. The
Ill-adviſed Tragedy of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> made Room and open'd
way for That of the King's, by letting in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s
pretenſions to the Crown, and ſoon ended in the Death of the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk</hi> himſelf. So unſafe is it for any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, how Great
ſoever, to preſume on his Own ſtrength againſt the Intereſt and
Policy of the Commonwealth. The Other Affairs of this Reign ſeem tranſacted
upon a ſtage of Fortune or Fate, rather than Prudence or Policy, trod between
a Headſtrong People, Ambitious Nobles, and a Queen too apt to Rule, and a
King too eaſy and apt to Suffer.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61249:43"/> If we may learn any thing from this Reign,
'tis only this, That Virtue and Goodneſs, without Policy and Juſtice, nor

all, Fate it ſelf ſeems to weigh down the Scale; his Father's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (is

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of Wiſdom to be, That he uſed That of other Mens alſo: He
call'd his Parliament, and conſulted with it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions,
eſpecially when he had any Provocations to War from <hi>France</hi> or
<hi>Scotland:</hi> Not inſiſting on, but ever wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that impertinent
piece of Prerogative, of Declaring War upon a King's own Head: This Method
open'd his Subjects Purſes; This procured even a Benevolence as odious as it
had been heretofore, and Great Sums of Money were ſoon collected by it: The
Commotions which happen'd in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> upon
gathering the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, were but ſlight Exceptions, taken on the
Occaſion of the Extravagancies and Paſſions of particular Perſons: And
the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Lambert Simnell,</hi> and the greater Attempt of
<hi>Perkin, Warbeck,</hi> were but the Effect of a Woman's Malice, and promoted
by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who was an Avowed Enemy to the Houſe
of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> tells us,
<q>His Time did excel for Good Commonwealth Laws; ſo that he
may be juſtly celebrated for the Beſt Law-giver to this Nation, after King
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61249:47"/> 
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt. For his Laws,
whoſo marks them well, are deep, and not Vulgar; not made upon the Spur of a
particular Occaſion for the preſent, but out of providence for the future,
to make the State of his People ſtill more and more happy, after the manner
of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in Ancient and Heroical Times.</q> I ſuppoſe he means
the State-Laws againſt Retainers and Riots; theſe ſeem more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to
be made on his own Account, and that no Perſon aſſiſting a King <hi>de
Facto</hi> ſhould be attainted therefore by courſe of Law, or Act of
Parliament; and that if any ſuch Act ſhould be made, it ſhould be void,
which ſeems alſo calculated for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſe (though it hath
ſince made ſo much noiſe in the World) [as the Act to take away the Writ
<hi>De Haeretico Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo,</hi> was in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
Time.] And this <hi>de Facto</hi> Act ſeems to have no foundation at that
time, unleſs it were for fear of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was the
laſt Heir-Male of the <hi>Plantagenets;</hi> for the King and People moſt
certainly knew, that <hi>Richard,</hi> the Younger Brother of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fifth, was Dead, and Safe, whom <hi>Perkin</hi> pretended to repreſent:
And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, after all, this Act ſeems to have but a Weak and
Diſhonourabble Foundation, and leaves an ill Savour, and will caſt a
Reflection ſome-where: For Fears and Jealouſies put
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61249:48"/> Men and Kings too often upon poor ſpirited
Actions. But letting this paſs; Another touch of his over-Wiſdom,
<hi>viz.</hi> his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſqueeze Money out of his Subjects
Purſes by Forfeitures on Penal Laws, was an Exceſs of Policy ſcarce to be
excuſed; and, as is ſaid, without all doubt proved the Blot of his Time;
and as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, There is no ſtring will
ſooner jarr in the Commonwealth than this, if it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally touched. This
was that which paſſed for the Diſgrace of his Reign, though what may
paſs under the Name of Severe Juſtice: And though he eſcaped the Violent
Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it himſelf, yet the fatal Return overtook
<hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> in the beginning of the next Reign, who
were both executed for Treaſon, for extending this <hi>Summum Jus</hi> to
Violence and Injury, and turning Law and Juſtice into Rapin; (Though it will
puzzle a Lawer to determine what Species of Treaſon this is, unleſs it be
againſt the Laws, by traiterouſly betraying the Truſt repoſed in them).

               <p>I Am not to determine how it came about, yet it may be
obſervable, That though this King came to the Crown by an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right of
Succeſſion, as Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> by his Father,
and of the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> by his Mother; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Coronation the
People were ask'd, Whether they would receive him for their King? But I know
this will be thought a trivial Matter of Form, not worth taking notice of. It
is ſaid his firſt Years were a Reign by Book, having come from the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Contemplation of Good, to Action; his Notions ſtuck by him
ſome Years: And not to pretend to ſingle Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience at thoſe Years, at
leaſt, That he might know how to perform his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oath, he choſe a
Wiſe Councel to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him in the Obſervation of the Laws; and as they
generally do in all New Reigns, He redreſs'd the Grievances of the former, by
making Examples of the Oppreſſors in the laſt. He did not enter into the
War with <hi>France</hi> upon his own Head, neither upon the Advice of his
Privy Council;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61249:49"/> but had it debated in Parliament, where it
was reſolved, That Himſelf with a Royal Army ſhould invade
<hi>France;</hi> and then for that purpoſe an Extraordinary Subſidy was
willingly granted towards the Charges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Theſe were the beginnings of
his Reign; and he might have finiſh'd it with the ſame Honour and Wiſdom,
if <hi>Woolſey</hi> had not piouſly told him, He might lay aſide the
uſe of his Underſtanding, and his own Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration (no doubt to rely on
his): That he ſhould not need to trouble himſelf with frequenting the
Council-Table, but might take his Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Admirable
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel for a Prieſt)! And he himſelf would give him Information,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the King, diſobliged the King's
Friends, caus'd the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> to
withdraw from Court, and Topp'd his Prerogative upon the King's, and led him
away by the Miſdirections of his own Falſe Oracle; perſuades and puts the
King upon Lending the Emperor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, who was poor and Inſolvent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
forſooth, the <hi>French</hi> King had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Revenue of the Biſhop
of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> that is, his Own. After he had tired the People with his
Civil Juſtice before, he ſets up for an Arbitrary Spiritual Power in
himſelf: Obtains an Office from the Pope to diſpence with Offences
againſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61249:49"/> Laws, and erects a Trade for Sin, to make
Virtue and Religion Venial, and betrays the King into the Reſtoring or
Surrendring <hi>Tourney,</hi> for great Gifts, and greater Promiſes, after
that he found it did not turn to Account, and he could make nothing of it by
way of Yearly Income: And thus diſhonour'd the King and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like a
very Godly Prelate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd the King and Court into all ſort of
Luxury, and the Prieſthood it ſelf into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and Diſorder:
And ſo far the Artificial Malice and Villany of this Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Bloody
Butcher's Son went, who had neither Honour or Religion, That he perſuaded the
King to ſacrifice his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to him, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
muſt be made an Example and Martyr to his Revenge, for only pouring a little
Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his Shooes, when he had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to dip his Hands in the
Baſon, whilſt the Duke held it to the King to waſh. He alone could create
Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings between the King, Lords and Commons, by vertue of his
Lies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of Matters from one to the other, altho' he
had been caught in them more than once: He diſſolv'd Convocations, by
vertue of his Power Legantine, which were convok'd by the Archbiſhop; and
calls Him and all the Clergy to another Place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Imperious
Fancy; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61249:50"/> the Laws of the Land, and ſeeks to raiſe
Money by Commiſſion, which the People oppoſed, and the King was
afterwards forced to Diſclaim: On the other hand abuſes the King's Grace,
and takes it upon himſelf; alters the State of the King's Houſe, Retrenches
the Allowance of his Servants; and in ſhort, arrogates the Power over
Servants, and Maſter alſo, and aſſumes the Power and Honour of the
King, and Stiles and Directs <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus</hi> in his Writings and
Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts: This could an humble
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the Apoſtles do? And by the bye, It may be worth
obſerving, how far Pride can inſpire theſe Prelatical Sparks with
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, who pretend to be but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Apoſtles,
to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above, and Lord it over Kings, whom yet they
themſelves acknowledge to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God: I regard not their
Diſtinctions, neither before nor ſince their Compliment of the Supremacy,
which they would reſume if they could, without a Pope. But it happen'd the
Cardinal carried on the Scene and State of Pageantry too far, even to his own
Ruin; and the King's Eyes were open'd at length, after that the Cardinal had
cut him out a way for the Ruin, or Reformation rather of the Church, as well as
himſelf; and by his Exorbitant Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had open'd the Door to the
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61249:50"/> to Redreſs the Grievances, and provide for
a Remedy againſt them, by reſtraining and wholſome Laws. I am the more
particular upon this Prelate, becauſe he was the Hinge upon which every thing
turn'd; and would ſet a Mark upon him for Kings to know whom to avoid, and
for what Reaſons: And would upon all Occaſions alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them how
wretched and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Creature a King is, when he abdicates his own
Reaſon, to ſubmit it to another's; and waves the Publick, for any private
Whiſpers of Admonition.</p>
               <p>I deſire to be excuſed from medling with the long Story of
the King's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Pope, and the Occaſion; and ſhall paſs over
the Alterations in Religion in this King's time; or what was more
conſiderable, the Change and Diſſolution of Religious Houſes: I have
nothing to do with his Shifting and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Wives neither: There are
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hiſtories of the Reformation enow, and freſh in every one's
Memory; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had an occaſion, not long ſince, to review them, and
conſider them afreſh. There are Plays and Novels alſo of the other to
gratify the Female Politicians; who, whether they ought to be ſevere
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61249:51"/> upon him, or not, I know not, and leave to
them to determine: This is beſides my Deſign, as being out of all Ordinary
Rules of Civil Policy: Therefore waving all Enquiry into the Reaſons or
Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of one or t'other, though I know ſome are aſſign'd and
remark'd to his Diſadvantage, others to his Advantage; I ſhall diſmiſs
my ſelf with this general Remark upon the Qualities of a Man, or King; That
when Either have once broke through the firſt Obligations of Juſtice or
Virtue, he makes but little difficulty in the proceeding upon At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the
ſame Nature: Though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, to ſpeak impartially, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reflection, I am not ſatisfied, but the firſt Occaſion of Divorce, and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation too, was in its ſelf juſtifiable, though the Circumſtances
inducing it, are ſuſpected; and it was concluded a Reaſon ſought, not
offer'd. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Character of him is not
to be juſtified, who ſays,
<q>That if all the Pictures and Paterns of a Mercileſs Prince
were loſt in the World, they might all again be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the life out of
the Story of this King: </q>And that of Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi> is as
ill-natur'd; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Having a Deſign to marry within the Degrees Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61249:51"/> he ſet his Learned Men at work to prove
it lawful; and after a while, being cloy'd, and deſiring Change, ſet them
again on work to prove it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; He never ſpared Man in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or
Woman in his Luſt:</q> This is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrically ſaid, but not truly; For he had
no mind to marry at firſt where he did, but did it in Obedience to his
Father's Will, and againſt the Grain with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And he liv'd with this
firſt Wife Twenty Years, and never took notice of the Unlawfulneſs of that
Marriage, till it was objected againſt him again, and the Preſident of
<hi>Paris</hi> ſtarted and moved it on the Propoſal of Marriage between the
Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (his Daughter by <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine)</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Orleance,</hi> the ſecond Son to the <hi>French</hi> King: And as to the
Cruelty towards Men, the Death of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and that of the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Son, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> ſound
moſt of Severity; yet as to the firſt, he had rais'd him from a Smith's
Son, he was Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Pupil, and trod in his Steps: He was
Attainted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Record ſays, for Crimes of Hereſy and
Treaſon, perhaps the Advice of the Match with the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of
<hi>Cleve;</hi> but I think it doth not argue Cruelty in the King neither
towards him or her:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61249:52"/> He diſmiſs'd her with a gentle Farewel
after her Marriage was declared Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the Convocation, and adjudged ſo
in Parliament; and ſhe lived ſixteen Years after, and died in the Fourth
Year of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> As to the other, It is plain it was not to gratify
his Perſonal Cruelty: For being no Lord of Parliament, he was Arraigned at
<hi>Guildhall</hi> before a Special Commiſſion, and found guilty by a Jury;
the Charge of bearing Arms which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the King and Prince, may ſeem
ſomewhat ſlight, yet it is always dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to play with Edged Tools, and
the <hi>Ragion di ſtato</hi> may in part excuſe it. In the main he appears
a King of a great deal of Honour, not without a Good-natur'd Generoſity: He
was careful alſo to maintain the Civil Conſtitution, and devout to the
Privileges of Parliament: He carried it fair with his Subjects in the general,
and was never Ill-natur'd or Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as far as I can perceive) without ſome
Colour of Juſtice. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can juſtify him in his Politicks
ſo well, in his contradicting by the Will, the Diſpoſition of the Crown,
and its Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he had before Eſtabliſhed in Parliament;
eſpecially to bring in Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> after his Subjects had ſworn to
the Parliamentary Succeſſion of his Daughter

               <p>I Am at a loſs in ſpeaking to the Short Reign of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: He ſeems born and deſign'd for the Advancement
of Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Polity, and to be ſnatched away to the
Diſappointment of Human Expectations; to intimate, That there is no
Eſtabliſhment of Happineſs to be relied on here below. However, that
Government which might have come to ſomething in himſelf, was Unfortunate
in the Adminiſtration of the Councel which his Father with ſo much Care had
aſſign'd him, and impertinently enough ſhuffled between the Aſpiring
Conduct of the Great Men, and the Fooliſh Ambition of Pretending Women:
Theſe interrupted the Wiſdom of Councels (though the Protector did his part
well enough at firſt, till he came to pull down a Church, and two Biſhops
Houſes in the <hi>Strand,</hi> to make him a Manſion-Houſe,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> For after the Diſturbances of the Nation on the Account of
Religion, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures at Home, and with relation to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61249:53"/> 
                  <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Abroad,
had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with Prudence and Honour, and the Kingdom began to appear
with a Face of Peace and Satisfaction: How vain are Mortal Conſiderations!
Behold the whole Oeconomy is on a ſudden Diſcompoſed, and the Frame of
Government Subverted: And a Frivolous Pretence of Place between two Women
Unhinges the Conſtitution, and firſt expoſes, and then deſtroys and
ruins the Husbands, by vertue of the Falſe Deſigns of a Third Perſon
behind the Curtain, who grafted Villany artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon their Follies, and
at laſt, as was ſuſpected, brought in the King himſelf, whoſe Death
alſo is laid at the ſame Door. What the Senſe of our Neighbours was
concerning it, you may read in <hi>Mezeray: </hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> held pretty good
Correſpondence, when Death cut the Thread of Young King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Days; It was believ'd to proceed from a ſlow Poyſon, and <hi>John
Dudley,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> was ſuſpected guilty of the
Crime, he having ſuggeſted to him to Inſtitute <hi>Jane</hi> of
<hi>Suffolk</hi> for Heireſs to the Crown:</q> However it were, it prov'd a
Fatal Policy to the poor Lady <hi>Jane</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too. I confeſs, I
cannot ſee why <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth might not make bold with
<hi>Mary,</hi> as well as his Father had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61249:54"/> him, and diſpoſe of the Crown by Will,
as he did; eſpecially for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating and Eſtabliſhing the Infant
Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, if that Age had been ſerious, and well agreed in the
Buſineſs of Religion: For we ſhall find, I doubt, in Hiſtory
(notwithſtanding all Obſervation to the contrary), That if Religion be not
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by State-props, it will not ſtand long; and that That which hath
only for its Ingredients Mercy and Honour, will be in ſhort time overrun, and
go to the Walls, whilſt the Religion of Violence and Blood will propagate it
ſelf by Inquiſitions, and the Artifices of its own pretended Zeal. And
that, notwithſtanding all Innocent Precautions, 'tis too true, That a Prince
of <hi>Matchiavell</hi>'s Compoſition, will at preſent, and for once,
prevail over one of a Sincere Vertue, and open Honour: This, I ſay, upon the
appearing Reaſon of the thing, That our Nation in particular may not be
impoſed upon over and over again with the ſame Appearances, and only that
we ſhould ſtand upon our Guard againſt all Popiſh Repreſentations,
how innocently ſoever colour'd; and againſt all Foreign Overtures, how well

ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied a Nation (of any Capacity of Thinking) in the Profeſſions of a
Papiſt, and what weight the Promiſes of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
Hereticks ought to have with Proteſtants.The Principles and Practices of
Papiſts were well enough known, even in thoſe times, in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Country of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, by the Execution of
ſo great a Number of Proteſtants, who were Burn'd in the <hi>Greve,</hi>
the common Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; but the manner of it was not Common:
<q>They were Haled up by a Pully and Iron Chain, then ſuffered
to fall down in the midſt of a great Fire; which was repeated ſeveral
times: And 'tis ſaid, the King himſelf would needs feed his own Eyes with
this Tragical and Melancholy Spectacle, and that the Horrible and Mournful
Shreiks of one of thoſe poor Wretches left ſo lively an Impreſſion in
his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61249:55"/> that all his Life long he had from time to
time a very frightful and terrible Remembrance of thoſe dreadful Groans:
However it were, it is certain that the Smell of thoſe Carcaſſes then
Roaſted, got into the Brains of a great many People; who on the one hand
beholding the (falſe) Conſtancy, as <hi>Mezeray</hi> calls it, and on the
other hand the ſcandalous diſſolute Living, named this Juſtice (as he
terms it) a Perſecution, and their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment a Martyrdom.</q>This is the
tender Account given of it by a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hiſtorian. And he ſays,
<q>Faggots were then lighted every where againſt the

through her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that ſhe would make no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religion; but before ſhe

and removed the Proteſtant Biſhops, and ſent <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> and others, to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and paſſed Judgment on them to Dye: All this before her

<q>When ſhe was once Abſolute Miſtreſs, ſhe Cemented
the Throne with the Blood of the Lady
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61249:55"/> 
                     <hi>Jane,</hi> her Husband, her Father,
and almoſt all her Kindred, and after that ſhe ſpilt much more to
Reſtore the Catholick Religion; which brought the State into ſuch
Convulſions as had like to have proved Mortal, and all for the Advantage of a
ſhort Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</q> Thus <hi>Mezeray</hi> ſtill, a <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Writer. And, in truth, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eſcaped
very narrowly; for <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that ſpecial Biſhop of
<hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> had procured her to be ſent to Priſon, and had
framed a Warrant under certain Councellors Hands to put her to Death; but that
Mr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> pitying her Caſe,
went to the Queen to know her Pleaſure, who utterly denied that ſhe knew
any thing of it, or was then aſhamed, at leaſt, to Own it; by which means
her Life was preſerved. This Good-natur'd Merciful Biſhop, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Prieſt, was not contented to Lop off Boughs and Branches, as he phras'd it at
the Council-Board, but was for plucking up the Reformation by the Root, meaning
Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> and to do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Juſtice, 'tis
ſaid they interceded for her; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was only in Policy, that their
Maſter might have Two Strings to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61249:56"/> his Bow, as it appeared by the ſequel; for
he Courted Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after the Death of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
'Twas evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent farther, how Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to keep her Word as
to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by her Match with <hi>Spain:</hi> No doubt ſhe had a mind to
put it out of her Power, and caſt the Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Perſecution off from her
ſelf. But we ought not to Reflect on her for Marrying one of her own
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſince our Proteſtant Kings on this ſide the Reformation have
had a good knack ever ſince of providing for the Security of the Proteſtant
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Popiſh Matches; for though King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt did

Papiſt, yet he was more to blame in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purſuing One ſo hotly

early (as another late One ſince); but had he let it alone a little longer,
till Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſhewed her ſelf more fully in her proper Colours;
when the Pope's Primacy came to be propoſed and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to be Reſtored,
and Cardinal

                  <hi>Pool</hi> came over, it might have had
another Effect, and proved a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Effort for the Reſcuing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Reformation from the Jaws of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Tyranny: For the Pope had juſt Taught
the People the way of being Abſolved from their Allegiance; and they might
infer if he could do it, or it were to be done for the ſake of Religion, That
they might Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve themſelves from their Allegiance for the good of
Religion alſo. But when once a firſt Undertaking miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, through an
ill-tim'd and raſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, a Second ſeldom or never comes to
Maturity in the ſame Shape and Nature. Her Five Years Reign paſſed in a

Lunatick Intervals of Mercy. It is ſaid her Reign was polluted with Blood of
Martyrs, Unfortunate by frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, and Inglorious by the Loſs

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61249:59"/> was then accounted the great Patroneſs
and only hopes of the Papiſts, and all the other Stratagems and viſible

Twenty fifth Year, and upon a juſt neceſſity of Self-preſervation, upon
the raſh and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Proceedings of <hi>Somervill</hi> and Others.
Beſides, when the Queen was informed even of theſe Severities (as they are
call'd), tender ones in compariſon; ſhe grew of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the
Commiſſioners for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cauſes, Reproved them for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
(although they declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, they Queſtioned no Man for his

State); and the Queen forbad them afterwards to uſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as ſhe did
the Judges other Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And not long after that, when Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Prieſts were taken, and ſome of them Condemned, and the reſt in danger of
the Law, ſhe only ſhipp'd them away out of <hi>England.</hi> A Merciful
piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice! So Merciful ſhe was, that it gave her Enemies ſuch
Encouragement, as her Life was never ſafe; (as may appear by the Caſe of
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Parry);</hi> till there was a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for an

Voluntary by a Number of her Subjects, the Earl
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61249:60"/> of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> being foremoſt,

the Year following was in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary manner Enacted into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Law.
Notwithſtanding which, another dangerous Conſpiracy of one <hi>Savage,</hi>
ſet on foot by <hi>Babington</hi> and Others to take away her Life, as being
Excommunicated, was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and about Fourteen were juſtly Executed

Severity of her Execution, with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61249:60"/> any but Papiſts; and the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at laſt, ſhews it was Extorted from her upon inevitable
Conſiderations, and Symptoms of a relucting neceſſity. Her often
Countermanding it, demonſtrates it was not an Act of her Inclination; and at
laſt, perhaps, (as far as it appears) it was obtained of her by Surpriſe,
and without her Authoriſing Hand to the finiſhing Stroke. If there were any
thing in it of Barbarity, 'twas the denying her a Catholick Prieſt or
Confeſſor, and the Manner of her Execution: Which yet is no more than
Papiſts deny Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants on all occaſions; and I know not why we
ſhould not vouch the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honour of our Religion, as they do of theirs. But
enough has been ſaid of this Tragedy on all Hands; only it may be fit to
Remark, That even the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians give a more favourable
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it than our own, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Mezeray</hi> is ſofter in

<q>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion of her Friends was no leſs the Cauſe
of her Misfortune, than the Wickedneſs of her Enemies; as the Firſt
ſought with violent paſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome plauſible pretence to Ruin
her, the Other furniſhed them with divers, by contriving every Hour ſome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61249:61"/> odd Deſign, and even Conſpiracies
againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> ſo that they made her Periſh by their
over-much Care and Endeavours to Save her.</q> The Later gives a ſlim,
trimming Account, which was worſe. Although 'tis true, the taking off the
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> did not break the Neck of the Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns (for
who can reſtrain the Malice of Jeſuits? for Men muſt have ſome
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of Modeſty to be convinc'd and ſilenc'd, and kept within the
bounds of natural Virtue) yet it ſtopp'd their Hands for ſome time. And
when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they began again upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Encouragement of the
Holy League in <hi>France</hi> (of which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was Head,
and in virtue of which they had taken off their own King, <hi>Henry</hi> the
III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, by the Hands of <hi>James Clement</hi> a Monk, though <hi>Guiſe</hi>
himſelf was firſt Aſſaſſinated); and they had taken new heart upon
the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Founding a Seminary of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> at
<hi>Validolid;</hi> and new Plots were contrived againſt the Queen: It put
them ſomewhat out of the way, and they were at a loſs where to find a
Succeſſor to the Crown for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when <hi>Lopez</hi> and
<hi>Patrick Cullen,</hi> &amp;c. were to have Killed the Queen: And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61249:61"/> they were forc'd to hunt after far-fetch'd
Titles in the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> at Home (the Son of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being a
Proteſtant); and even at laſt they made but little of it: The Queen
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Peace and Safety, and their Pretender <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was
himſelf Executed for Treaſon. The Affairs of the Church were ſo prudently
managed in her time with relation to Puritans as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that ſhe
left it in a Condition to ſtand upon its own Legs, and maintain it ſelf
without Danger from Oppoſition; had it been preſerv'd with the ſame
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Zeal and unſhaken Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by her Succeſſors. As to her
Civil Adminiſtration, the Heathen and <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> the
<hi>Perſians</hi> and Idolaters, the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> name her with Reverence. And <hi>Boſſac</hi> in one

               </p>
               <p>She choſe her ſelf a Wiſe Councel, and ſhewed her own
Wiſdom in being Adviſed by them. She had a hard Game to play with
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well as her own Popiſh Subjects; yet
ſhe managed both ſoftly and by degrees, and at laſt by Parliament fix'd
and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61249:62"/> ſecured the general Alteration in
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ſhe could never have done by her ſelf. Firſt-Fruits and
Tenths were Reſtored to the Crown, and the Supremacy Confirmed to the Queen.
She avoided Matrimony, whether upon any Conſideration beſides Prudence, I
ſhall not enquire; by doing ſo, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd her ſelf Head of the
Church and State, and Miſtreſs of her ſelf as well as her Subjects; and
Oblig'd and Silenc'd the Parliament by ſoft Anſwers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, when they
Remonſtrated to her for that purpoſe, and put an unanſwerable Compliment
upon them, by telling them, <hi>She had placed her Affections upon her People
in General.</hi> But in matters of Religion ſhe was no Courtier; after ſhe
had once declared her ſelf a Proteſtant (though ſome pretend ſhe
Diſſembled in her Siſter's Days) ſhe did not look back towards the
Pope, did not ſhuffle in her Religion, but refuſed all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with
him, and alſo generouſly declined all the Overtures of Advantage made by
<hi>Pius</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. She equally deſpiſed his Threats and Temptations:
Afterwards ſhe readily and ſincerely Aſſiſted the Diſtreſſed
Proteſtants, her Neighbours, on all Occaſions. She provided every thing for
the Strength
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61249:62"/> and Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation, and ſaw it maintain'd in its True Glory both at Home and Abroad:
Would not be whead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor huff'd to betray it, but carry'd its Reputation
farther Abroad than any of her Predeceſſors had, or Succeſſors
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have done. She ſhew'd it the way to overcome even the Invincible
Armada of <hi>Spain,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with all their Force and
Fraud had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to Invade us, and baſely to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us by Surprize, when
they were at the ſame time in a (Treacherous) Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Peace: And all
this ſhe did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppreſſing her Subjects, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as ſhe
her ſelf declared, when ſhe remitted a Fourth Subſidy) that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was as ſure in her Subjects Coffers as her Own. 'Tis ſaid of her, Never
Prince ruled with more Juſtice, and with her Juſtice mingled more of Mercy:
She was term'd St. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by ſome at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> for her
Merciful returning home cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Italians</hi> which were taken Priſoners
in the Invaſion of 1588. And 'tis ſaid, ſome told the Lord
<hi>Carleton,</hi> being then Ambaſſador, That though they were Papiſts,
yet they would never pray to any other Saint; a Compliment at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
may be laid hold of at home, for an acknowledgment of a juſt Character.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61249:63"/> But her Trueſt Character we may take from
her own Behaviour, and from her own Mouth, becauſe it ſeems to have nothing
of Vanity in it: In her Speech to her laſt Parliament, 1601. ſhe thus
expreſſeth her ſelf.
<q>To be a King, and to wear a Crown, is a thing more Glorious to
them that ſee it, than it is Pleaſant to them who bear it: Though you may
have had, and may have many Mightier and Wiſer Princes ſitting in this
Seat, yet you never had, nor ſhall have, Any that will love you better.</q>
                  <hi>Du Serres</hi> ſays of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of
<hi>France,</hi> her Contemporary:
<q>It is a Sign of a Happy Reign, when the Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to
ſee their Prince:</q> 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he might mean it as well of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> Or we may apply it for him, as it was verified of her: For
it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in her ſhort Progreſſes, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all ſorts
would flock to ſee her? And not only that, (for I have known other Kings
attended through Curioſity) but alſo what hearty Acclamations did they
utter? As God ſave Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, &amp;c.</hi> and ſhe would Reply,
God bleſs you, my People all. Few Princes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry who have the Affections
of the better part of their People: 'Twas for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61249:63"/> this Reaſon, I ſuppoſe, that the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> her profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Enemy, ſaid,
<q>
                     <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was the moſt
Glorious and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Woman that ever ſwayed Scepter:</q> And <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> in a Letter to Monſieur <hi>de Roſny,</hi>
commends her with an implicit ſort of Emulation. She had ſuch a Character
even with the <hi>Turks</hi> for Morality, and Natural Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, That at her
Inſtance he counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trading there, and thence
came, as is ſaid, our <hi>Turky</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and every one knows the
Benefit of it to <hi>England.</hi> Alſo the Duke of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> for
her ſake, as is ſaid, (who yet is ſo jealous of Strangers) gave Civil
Reception to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In ſhort, That Kingdom which ſhe found
in Troubles, and unſetled, ſhe left Eſtabliſh'd in True Religion, Peace
and Plenty at Home, and Reputation Abroad.</p>

               <p>I Dare not Encounter this King ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſome have done
('tis ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good Experience): Nor would I be thought to offer Undecent
Reflections at a King, who came Uſhered into our Throne with ſuch a
Reputation for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own, and ſuch Advantages of a Councel, left
him fam'd for it. Yet in my own Opinion, and poor Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I can't for
my Soul pay that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Veneration to his Character and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory which the
World would ſeem to demand. He ſeems to me to have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the
Threſhold in our Kingdom, and to have done a thing not very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or
Prudent. Who, after he had ſo poorly quitted the Reſentments of his
Mother's Death before, by a ſort of Reflex Malice; yet in pious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of
her Sufferings, and to revive the Reaſons of them here, and as it were, to
Countenance and Abet the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> Family upon the ſame Foundations,
forthwith calls the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61249:64"/> 
                  <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> two Papiſts, to
the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, thereby intimating, as it were, hopes to the Papiſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they were apt enough, no doubt, to conceive. Nor will
his Pretended Apprehenſion of the Pope's Briefs to the Catholicks, excuſe
him: Tho Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> (who was bribed by a Knighthood at his
firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over) repreſents him in the front, to have done it only upon
Prudential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; that is, Fear: Thus he at firſt daſh diſobliged all
Parties. And who knows, but this firſt Caſt of Favour to them, and to the
Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> (whoſe Father, 'tis true, was a great Friend to
<hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but a greater to Popery); and his
partial, aukward Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards other Gentlemen, might be the Foundation of
that complicated Treaſon by the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Rawleigh,</hi> and others, Proteſtants and Papiſts, amongſt whom were two
Prieſts, and for which there was no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Occaſion, only that he
provok'd all Parties, whilſt he ſought to win One, by Fawning; to ſhew
ſomething like good Inclinations to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Pope
expected, though they well knew, he did not mean that neither; whilſt he
received others cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Reaſons neither he nor they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61249:65"/> knew: So that they agreed, only in this, to
lay him aſide, who, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by his Behaviour, would anſwer the
Expectations of neither. There was no neceſſity of adding Papiſts as
Spies upon his Councels; he might in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been contented to have taken it
at preſent, as left him, with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of his <hi>Scotchmen</hi> to
the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: And 'tis plain it gave no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Papiſts by the
Powder-Plot which followed: His Next Step of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Wiſdom was
diſſolving the Parliament, for Reaſons known to no body beſides
himſelf; 'tis ſaid, becauſe they did not comply with his Deſigns; but
what thoſe Deſigns were, do not appear Above-board. The Third Action of
Moment, out of common Forms, was the ſacrificing Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>
to the Importunities of <hi>Gondomar</hi> (for neither his Juſtice nor Mercy
was to be relied on); that is, giving up the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Satisfaction. And his Conduct, with relation to
<hi>Spain,</hi> is admirable throughout.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had pretty well humbled that Potent
Monarch; and, as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> obſerves, forced him in his
after-Reign (that is, after his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61249:65"/> Tricks with her) to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that
he was driven to break all Faith with thoſe Princes that truſted him, and
paid for One Year's Intereſt above Twenty five thouſand Millions of Crowns:
Hear Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> who ſpeaks to the Perſon of King
<hi>James,</hi> and therefore we may aſſure our ſelves modeſtly and
gently:
<q>So low and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in Fortunes your Highneſs found him,
when you took this Crown; Thus from the abundant Goodneſs of your Peaceable
Nature (this is the way of Banter, if Kings would ſee it) you were pleas'd to
begin your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reign with General Quiet, and with <hi>Spain</hi> firſt,
which ſhould have wrought in Noble Natures a more Grateful Recompence than
after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: For long it was not before <hi>Tyrone</hi> was hearten'd to
Rebel againſt your Highneſs; and flying, had a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at <hi>Rome</hi>
paid him from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Agent: His Son <hi>Odonel Tyrconnel,</hi>
and others, your Chiefeſt Rebels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ever ſince in Grace and Pay
with the Arch-Ducheſs, at <hi>Spain</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. So ſoon as your
Eldeſt Son of holy Memory, now with God, was fit for Mariage, they began
theſe Old Deſigns, by which before they had thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61249:66"/> ſo well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Thus Sir
<hi>R. C.</hi> in that Stile.</p>
               <p>And thus they led him on their Dance, whilſt he Deſerted
(or, what was worſe, ſo meanly Vindicated) the Intereſt of his Son-in-Law
the Prince <hi>Palatine:</hi> He muſt take his Meaſures from
<hi>Gondomar;</hi> and inſtead of aſſiſting him with a Powerful Army,
he is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Agent, and muſt take his Advice,
and Matters are to be made up with him, by a Match for his Son the Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and then
ſuffers himſelf to be impoſed upon by Idle Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which this
Ambaſſador carried on only in Diſguiſe to ſerve his Maſter's Ends;
whilſt in the mean time the Poor <hi>Palatine</hi> is ſwallowed up by a
Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy between the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all this
without calling a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; that being, forſooth, an Affront to his
Wiſdom; then ſends his Son to <hi>Spain,</hi> when he was told by Sir
<hi>John Digby, &amp;c.</hi> (who adviſed him not to ſuffer his
Reſolutions to be interrupted by that Overture) of the Falſe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
and Inſincerities of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which the Letters from the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Olivares,</hi> and his Anſwer,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61249:66"/> would have convinced any one of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
himſelf; and after that, his making ſo many and ample Conceſſions in
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Popery during the Treaty. And in truth, Treating of any Popiſh
Match, are no great Arguments of Wiſdom, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care, or indeed of
Religion: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy muſt be neglected, on pretence
intimated by <hi>Gondomar,</hi> that the furniſhing of it would breed
ſuſpicion in the King his Maſter; and the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns muſt be
rendred up, being the Keys of the Low-Countries, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige his Friend
<hi>Gondomar</hi> too: His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> muſt be Check'd,
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd, and Silenced, for oppoſing this Popiſh Match, with their
Speeches, Counſels, Wiſhes, and even Prayers; ('tis ſaid
<hi>Gondomar</hi> could Diſſolve Parliaments alſo.) The Proteſtant
Intereſt on his Son's Account in <hi>Bohemia</hi> ſlighted; though
Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> repreſented the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Call of
Religion to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, beſides Honour: Though his Ambaſſador
<hi>Cottington</hi> inform'd how Matters went, and though every body, beſides
himſelf, ſaw through the Deſigns of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well in the
Complimenting him in the Match as Mediatorſhip, to keep him Neuter, and hold
him in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And though he himſelf ſaw it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61249:67"/> turn to a War of Religion, and would be the
Overthrow of the Proteſtants or Evangelicks; and though the Emperor had
proſcribed the Prince <hi>Palatine;</hi> yet King <hi>James</hi>'s Eyes would
not be open'd, nor would be perſuaded to take the Alarm. Theſe are no great
Maſter-ſtrokes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, no more than of Conſcience or Honour: And to
War at laſt, when all was loſt againſt his own avow'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, was an
Incomprehenſible Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Judgment and Wiſdom. Beſides theſe, of
which he diſcharged himſelf thus learnedly, there was no Matter of Moment
did or could Occur du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Reign, to exerciſe any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Talent.
As for the Governing his People, 'tis plain he had King-Craft, as his Friend
Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> calls it, as is pretty Evident by his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Speeches, and his Ways of getting Money. He could alſo Diſſemble, and
ſometimes Huff, but 'twas only his own Subjects, and that with no good Grace
neither.</p>
               <p>He had Prieſt-Craft too, as <hi>Heylin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, who
tells us,
<q>'Twas his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Practice in the whole Courſe of his
Government, to Balance one extreme by the other, Countenancing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61249:67"/> againſt the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and the
<hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> ſometimes againſt the Papiſts.</q> Thus he was Devout
for the <hi>Church of England</hi> at Home, and for Popery A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; making
Canons for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity here, and ſubmitting our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Truckle to
the Popiſh Match, againſt all the Remonſtrances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Church,
and People: What could he expect from this Popiſh Match, from any Popiſh
Match, but the Conſequences all the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected? That it would let in
Popery once more into Hopes of Succeſs, at leaſt to gain Breath by a
ſuſpenſion of the Laws againſt them: What could be expected but that
this muſt create Jealouſies and Miſunderſtandings between him and his
Subjects? And 'twas not ſending a Synod of Divines to <hi>Dort,</hi> or
having a Convocation at Home (of which Dr. <hi>Overal,</hi> his Dean of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s, has given a ſpecial Account for the Edification of his
Succeſſor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dean) could likely ſettle the Affairs of the
Church in <hi>Europe,</hi> when he at the ſame time was giving the Pope a
Lifting-hand, and rais'd his droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Head here ſo early after the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and when at the ſame time the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,
France,</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61249:68"/> the Low-Countries, were groaning under a
Perſecution. Which made <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> complain, <hi>Que Sa
Majeſtie D'Angleterre trop arreſte à quelques petits,
diſſenſions entre les Siens, n'evoit pas aſſez de ſoin de la
gueriſon de plus profondes playes qui ſont en l'Eglise;</hi> and which made
the Houſe of Commons Petition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate in the Force of Fourteen
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Ten Remedies, in the XIX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his Reign; which had only
this Effect, to make him fly to his old Refuge of Prerogative with a Huff: And
that the Mariage of his Children, Peace and War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Matters
of State and Government above their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: And Speeching it
backwards and forwards (which he took great Delight in) till his Son-in-Law was
deſpoiled of his Ancient Patrimony, which he at laſt ingenuouſly
confeſs'd was through his Default. Here's the Effect of Prerogative! Theſe
Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I ſuppoſe, put Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> upon Enquiry what
the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had done in the like Caſes: And after great
pains in the ſearch of Records, he informs us,
<q>That the Kings of this Nation, ever ſince the Conqueſt,
ſo ſoon as they were cool enough for Councels, have uſually conſulted
with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61249:68"/> their Peers in the great Council, and
Commons in Parliament, of Mariage, Peace, and War.</q> He might have ſaid
before the Conqueſt alſo; for <hi>Harold,</hi> who had promiſed
<hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to take one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to
Wife, Anſwers, That he ſhould be very injurious to his own Nobility, if he
ſhould without their Conſent and Advice take a Stranger to Wife. If we look
into our Neighbour Kingdoms, <hi>Mezeray</hi> will tell us, That the
<hi>French,</hi> during the two firſt Races, and part of the third, had a
Right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle and controul the Mariages of their Kings; and neither
could the King make War without the Lords In ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, I know not whether
Kings in Reaſon ought to be permitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Ambaſſadors on
t'other ſide of Forms, upon their own Heads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Quorum</hi> of
their Councils: For Nations generally ſend the ſharpeſt Men on ſuch
Errands, and ſometimes Kings are not a Match in Politicks for them, as it
plainly appeared by this Story this King was not for <hi>Gondomar,</hi> who
outwitted him, who pretended to be the wiſeſt. But King <hi>James</hi> came
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us, Tinctur'd with his <hi>Scotch</hi> Notions of Monarchical and
Sovereign
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61249:69"/> Abſolute Power, without vouchſafing
ever after to conſider the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and he lets us
ſee what Opinion he had of Parliaments in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wherein
he
<q> Adviſes his Son to hold no Parliaments but for
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of new Laws, which would be but ſeldom:</q> Not, it ſeems,
for the State, Matters of War, Mariage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, not for raiſing
Money neither, ſo long as he could get it by Privy-Seals and Benevolences.
Beſides, after all, he did not come hither without ſome Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> People, though he had none to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
Thus there may ſeem to be ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences in a Learn'd Crown'd Head:
This King thought himſelf too Wiſe, and too Knowing; He was above Advice or
Inſtruction, becauſe, as he thought, he was capable of giving it: He was
too wiſe in himſelf to be taught by others, and yet not wiſe enough
always to follow thoſe Rules of Wiſdom which he had given; As is evident by
the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Theory and Practice; and by his inconſiſtent
Directions to his Sons, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi> He was a little
too much addicted to the Pedantry of a Scholar, and affected with Polemical
Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Words, which he dreaded in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb facs="tcp:61249:69"/> Was more for determining Quarrels by the Pen, than
the Sword: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might have made a better Biſhop than a King; a better
Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, than Country; as being better ſeen in the Oeconomicks,
than Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Nation.</p>

in an Extended Prerogative, and the latter enlarging their Liberties ſomewhat
beyond a modeſt Bound; and there were Courtiers in thoſe Days alſo,
ſuch as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> obſerv'd, in Court Language to
Complement a King, call'd it Rebellion to mention a Parliament; and
<hi>Lewis</hi> alſo was a ſuperſtitious Friend to the Church, whilſt he
was aſſaulting and oppreſs'd the State. In theſe and ſuch like
Circumſtances of Notional Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in ſuch State of picqueering
Miſunderſtanding, King <hi>James</hi> left his Crown to King
<hi>Charles,</hi> and in a War for Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Money, and in a fair way of Quarrel at Home, as well as Abroad. Beſides,
the People had it in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories and Conſideration, his Complaiſant
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61249:71"/> Behaviour in <hi>Spain,</hi> his Letter to,
and Tampering with the Pope in Order to that Match, which rais'd new
Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies on Account of Religion; and his Compleating himſelf the Match
with <hi>France</hi> with as Frank Articles for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as had before been
offer'd to <hi>Spain</hi> in Conjunction with his Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them in
them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons and Conſiderations took poſſeſſion
juſtly enough in the Minds of Men, which made them ever after ſtand upon
their guard: And ſetting aſide all thoſe Scurrilous Authors on the One
hand, who have pretended to give us a Narrative of his Actions; and alſo
thoſe Fulſome Ones, on the Other; all thoſe who would Depreſs or
Advance his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with Art; certainly a great many Actions of his
Adminiſtration are not to be juſtified in a Court of Honour or Wiſdom:
Such as Diſſolving the Firſt Parliament meerly in Complaiſance to the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> A King muſt neceſſarily Diſoblige and
Affront the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, when he Eſpouſeth the Intereſt of a Single
Perſon againſt the Publick; and it ſhews a Weakneſs to put one Man (no
better than the reſt) in the Scales in competition with Mankind, as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61249:72"/> it were: But eſpecially a King ought to
be ſure the Subject-matter of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Preference is good and
juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, otherwiſe he commits a double Error. It will be thought
Ill-natur'd to Argue againſt Favourites; but I muſt Argue againſt the
Argument for them: It is a very odd Inference, That becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had
his Favourite-Diſciple, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings muſt have their Favourites: I
ſuppoſe No body will pretend there is any parity of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who,
without Diſpute, had betrayed the Vantguard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the
<hi>French,</hi> after the King and he knew both that they were to be employed
againſt the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> this was in it ſelf a great Abuſe to the
Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and a manifeſt Injuſtice and
Injury to the Proteſtant Religion. And 'twas from this King's Reign that the
<hi>French</hi> began to Date their Strength at Sea. This only Action bred
ſuch ill Blood, and created ſo great a Miſunderſtanding at firſt
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Subjects, as ſtuck to the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> till his Death, whom <hi>Felton</hi> kill'd; and, I doubt,
till the King's too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:61249:72"/> His next Proceeding was Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when he had thus Diſſolv'd the Firſt Parliament: To Levy Money by Privy
Seals, which had ſo ill a ſavour in his Father's Time, and then to call a
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſently on the neck of that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, and to ſide with
the D. of <hi>B.</hi> againſt the E. of <hi>B.</hi> and the denying the
latter his Writ to Parliament; this lookt inconſiderate, and a little mean;
and the interpoſing ſo much on behalf of the former, even with paſſion
as well as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, had but an ill grace. I paſs by the Buſineſs of
the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> which alſo could not but breed ill Blood in the
Houſe of Peers. By the King's Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in theſe Affairs (though I do
not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to juſtify the Houſe of Commons in theirs), inſtead of
preſerving one Friend, in the mean time he ſacrifices all the reſt to his
Humour: For the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> who (at his Inſtance chiefly) had
taken up Arms in his Quarrel, was beaten, and reduced to great Diſtreſs,
for want of Succors from <hi>England,</hi> which the King had thus diſabled
himſelf to ſupply according to his Promiſe. That Neceſſity put him
again upon Indirect Courſes for Raiſing of Money by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of
Loan, and ſeiſing all Duties
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61249:73"/> of Cuſtoms, Privy-Seals, Benevolences,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he would ſhew he deſign'd, if he had prevail'd, to
live on himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parliament. But the Impriſoning the Gentlemen
for refuſing the Loan, and the Suſpending and Diſgracing Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<hi>Abbot</hi> for refuſing to Licenſe <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>'s Book, were
Strains of Arbitrary Power, which expoſed Religion as well as Law into a
Jeſt; and ſeem to profane the Sacred Title of a King, as well as that of an
Archbiſhop; as appears eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that Archbiſhop's Narrative and
Dialogue, with the Paſſages therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, if it be true, which
expoſes that whole Tranſaction as a plain Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montade and Defiance to all
Rules of Juſtice and Reaſon. I will take notice only of the Obſervation
of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop upon the Fourth Objection to <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>'s Sermon,
by which you may gueſs at the reſt: To the Fourth;
<q>Let the Largeneſs of thoſe words be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
ſays the Archbiſhop; yea all Antiquity to be abſolutely for Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Obedience to Princes in all Civil or Temporal things, for ſuch Caſes as
<hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard may fall within this; and if I had allow'd this for
Doctrine, I had been juſtly beaten with my own Rod: If the King the next day
had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61249:73"/> commanded me to ſend him all the Money
and Goods I had, I muſt, by my own Rule, have obey'd him: And if he had
commanded the like to all the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> by
<hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Propoſition, and the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>'s allowing of the ſame, they muſt have ſent in all,
and left their Wives and Children in a Miſerable Caſe; yea the Words extend
ſo far, and are ſo abſolutely deliver'd, that by this Divinity, If the
King ſhould ſend to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
thereof, commanding them to give unto him all the Wealth they have, they were
bound to do it: There is a <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> in Chriſtian
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths; and according to Laws and Cuſtoms Princes may diſpoſe of
it. That Saying being true, <hi>Ad Reges Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas omnium pertinet, ad
ſingulos proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>
                  </q> This was the Senſe of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop on
this Matter; and yet the King eſpouſed the Fancies of a <hi>Sibthorp</hi>
againſt him, who was not ſo much as a Batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Arts, only for the
merit of his Flattering Divinity: And in truth the whole Proceeding is apt to
turn one's Stomach; beſides, that the King in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Dignity of a
Perſon of ſuch a Figure in the Church, did alſo make
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61249:74"/> bold with his own Character at ſecond
hand, who ſtood but one Remove Higher. And what was it but to intimate to the
Lay-Gentlemen, that neither of them were ſo ſacred or inviolable as was
pretended: And, by the by, 'tis not ſafe to make too Light of a Spiritual
Perſon, they can't be held too ſacred on this ſide of Infallibility: But
how like a Prophet did the Archbiſhop talk? How did he Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon like a
Stateſman concerning the King and Duke of <hi>Buckingham?</hi> How did the
Event but too well juſtify the Predictions? What could the King expect from
his Next Parliament, which he was in a manner forc'd to Call, after the
Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of ſo many Gentlemen, and the Poor-ſpirited Way of
Releaſing them, which lookt almoſt as bad as the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning them? What
could he ſay after that Unfortunate Action in the <hi>Iſle of Rhee?</hi>
'Twould make one ſick to reflect on Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Speech and
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in compariſon with the Giddy Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Meaſures taken at Court.
What Event that Parliament was like to have, may be ſeen, together with the
Talent of theſe two Kings, the Father and Son's King-Craft, in the Jeſuits
Letter, in the Speeches within Doors and without, and in the Petitions, Debates
and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61249:74"/> after that the King had brought himſelf
and his Honour in Jealouſy with the People, and the People underſtood the
Circumſtances of his Adminiſtration, and Preſſures of his Affairs. But
to ſhew there were ſome Diſpoſitions to Agreement, the King's granting
the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right had almoſt reconciled and ſoften'd all theſe
Diſcontents and Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; till the Old Bone was thrown in
again, and the Buſineſs, that unhappy Buſineſs of the Duke of
<hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> reſumed, which cauſed Ill-natur'd Reflections, and in
which, perhaps, all Parties were too ſtiff: Hence the Old Game was plaid over
again. This ſet up the Diſpute of Tunnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; this Prorogued the
Parliament, and after many Exorbitant Bickerings about Religion, and Levying
this Duty, or Branch of the Revenue, the Blood was put into ſuch a ferment,
that although the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was gone, the Parliament was
diſſolved in a heat. It is pretty hard to find an Impartial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the
Tranſactions of theſe Times: By what appears, no doubt ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of
the Houſe of Commons had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves inſolently enough; but to do
Juſtice on the other hand, there was ſome provocation on the King's Part,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61249:75"/> not only before, but after the Death of the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The preferring <hi>Montague</hi> to a Biſhoprick
for his <hi>Appello Caeſarem,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> to another Good
Benefice, with a Diſpenſation, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Parliament, who had
Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and perpetually diſabled him for the future to Eccleſiaſtical
Preferment in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and taking <hi>Laud</hi> into
ſo peculiar favour, as in pious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
(for otherwiſe he had been obnoxious to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure juſtly); and making
<hi>Weſton</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, who died a Papiſt; and <hi>Windebank</hi>
afterwards Secretary of State: Beſides theſe Odd Promotions, the Malicious
and hard Proſecution of the Merchants, even to Ruin, for not paying the
Cuſtoms; and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Overtures which were diſcover'd for breaking
Parliaments for the future, and to ſet up Something in Imitation of the
Aſſembly <hi>des Notables,</hi> (for he always collogued with the Lords) to
introduce what ſhould be very like Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Theſe were all things
of ill digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and did not look like Touches of a Complexion with a
Limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. I take no notice of the Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor of
ſome Intervening Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions at Home, which are Myſterious, and prov'd
Unfortunate, though they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61249:75"/> might bear a candid Conſtruction with
ſome. The Buſineſs of Ship-Money was the Invention of his
Attorney-General <hi>Noy;</hi> and the Project was backt with the Opinion of
all the Judges <hi>obiter,</hi> and confirm'd by the Judgment of Ten of them on
mature Deliberation: But how unhappily ſoever that Affair was reſented, and
ſucceeded at laſt, this at leaſt muſt be ſaid in vindication of the
King, That he did apply the Money to the true Uſe; did equip a Gallant Fleet
with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Trade was not only made ſecure by ſcowring the Seas
of Pyrates, but in aſſerting the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſaved <hi>Flanders</hi> from being ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up between the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> reſcued the Fiſhery from the
Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter by ſeizing or diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Buſſes,
which were fiſhing on our Coaſts, and made them petition humbly, for what
they before by force of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and by force of Arms, arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſerted, and claim'd as a Right; and thus maintain'd the Dominion of the
Seas, and advanc'd the Reputation of the Kingdom Abroad.</p>
               <p>But we will now come again to the Church, which firſt and
laſt diſorder'd the Scene of Affairs in the State: Here we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61249:76"/> ſee the Misfortune of a Popiſh Match,
which renders all Things and Perſons ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and gives a latitude for
Enemies to work by Mines, who could not have hurt Us by Batteries. This makes
an Archbiſhop, who was guilty only of Pride and Raſhneſs, ſuſpected
for Popery alſo: Whilſt Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and
Nuntio's, Prieſts and Jeſuits in Maſquerade, blow up the Coals, till they
had kindled the Nation into a War; and not only that, but their Prieſts
perſonally engage in it, for fear it ſhould not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually be carried on,
unleſs they were in it on both Sides. That theſe things are true, is paſt
all doubt; and as to the laſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Mentet Hiſt. de Troubles
de Grand Britain,</hi> who muſt be admitted to be a Faithful Author on this
Account.</p>
               <p>And here we are launch'd into a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea; here I deſire
to draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for all the reſt of this Unfortunate King's Life is too
Troubled and Stormy for Calm Remarks of Policy. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration came too
late, I believe, even from the firſt want of it; the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of
Jealouſy were ſo ſtrong, that all the other ſubſequent Debates could
ſignify nothing towards Satisfaction; all the conſequential Meetings and
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61249:76"/> were Tumults rather than Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, after
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Air of Sedition blew this way; the firſt falſe
Meaſures are ſeldom or never to be retriev'd. All this King's
ſubſequent Actions could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abſolutely undeceive his People; they
muſt ſtill believe him Popiſhly affected, though they were almoſt
convinc'd he was not a Papiſt. 'Tis impoſſible to diſpoſſeſs an
enraged Multitude, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſatisfy generous Minds under
prepoſſeſſions and prejudices of Opinion. The Wounds were too deep for
a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cure. I preſume not to Arraign or Juſtify his Conduct: He ſeems
to have been a better Man than King; and a better Churchman than he was
believed to be<hi>:</hi> 'Tis evident, beyond poſſibility of doubt, that he
was charged falſly with being a Papiſt. But when a Man has brought
himſelf to the circumſtances of Trimming between two Extremes, he is in
danger of being Cruſh'd by Both. And that had been King <hi>James</hi>'s
Fate, no doubt, had he been link'd to a Papiſt as well as his Son; whereas
had King <hi>Charles</hi> Married one of the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, neither
his own Trimming, nor his Father's would have hurt him; but having Married a
Papiſt, his Father's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity and Prieſt-craft Ruined the Son,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61249:77"/> without deſcending upon him. For
Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts, ſo long as we Harbour them, will ſting one way or
other. <hi>Henry</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> fell by the
Hands of a couple of Prieſts, upon another ſort of ſuſpicion; but Ours
at ſecond hand from Prieſts, who were not contented only to Kill him,
unleſs they Deſtroyed the Conſtitution alſo. Hard Circumſtances of
this poor King! to be purſued by the Fanatick Party as giving too great
Countenance to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and by the Papiſts for not giving them enough, and
not coming up to anſwer their Expectations. This I take to be the Caſe, and
this the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Popiſh Match; and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was at the
bottom: For though it be ſaid the Puritans had a Deſign to throw him out of
the Saddle, right or wrong, and that nothing of Conceſſions ſhould ever
ſatisfy them; (and this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may be true of ſome very ſower
Zealots, and extravagant Pretenders); yet 'tis improbable, and what they could
never have hoped for; and the greater part of the Presbyterians were drawn in
by Surpriſe, who did not foreſee the end, and withdrew afterwards, when,
'tis true, 'twas too late. But after all, the deſign was carried on in other
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61249:77"/> beſides our own, and by other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
beyond ours: And Popiſh Prieſts had not only their Heads but Hands alſo
in the Buſineſs, not only in Peace but War likewiſe; as you may read in
<hi>Mentet,</hi> who would not lie in that Affair; 'tis a pretty ſcarce Book,
and therefore I will give you his Words; he ſays, ſpeaking of the Battel of
<hi>Edge-Hill, Ce que ſurprit le plus tout le Monde ce fut qu' on trouua
quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Preſtres parmi les Morts du Coſté des Eſtates: Car
Encore que Dans leurs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtes ils appellaſſent l' Armeé du Roy
l' Armeé des Papiſtes pour le rendre Odieux au Peuple, ils avoient
neamoins deux Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnies de Wallons &amp; d'autres Catholiques dans leur
Armeé, Outre qu' ils avoient rien oublié pour taſcher d'
engager en leur Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie le Chevalier</hi> Arthur Aſton, <hi>Colonel
Catholique de grand Reputation.</hi> And he ſays before, That the King
publiſhed an Edict at <hi>Stonely</hi> (afore that) wherein he tells them, He
did not mean that any Papiſt ſhould come to ſerve in his Army, that he
might not give Diſcontent or Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to his Proteſtant Subjects; but
then 'twas too late for ſuch like Overtures of Honour or Profeſſions of
Sincerity. But to go on with <hi>Mentet; Il eſt vray que le Roy avoit
auſſi ſou ert dans ſon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meé quelques Officiers Catholiques,
Homes de</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61249:78"/> 
                  <hi>grand ſuffiſance &amp; les bien
intentionées pour le bien de l' Eſtat, ainſi les appella't 'il, dans
la declaration qu' il' fit publier apres le Battail, à quoy les
Eſtates n' oublierent pas de repondre par autant des Contredits. Il temoigne
qu' encore que les Eſtates euſſent ſans Compariſon plus grand Nombre
des Catholiques, que luy dans leur Armeé, &amp; qu' ils euſſent
taſché, par toutes ſortes de moyens de gaigner tous ceux du Royaume
leur ayant fait promettre ſous main que moyennant qu' ils vouluſſent
prendre partie avec eux. On abrogeroit toutes les Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances faites à
leur prejudice: Il ne pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voit toute fois ſe reſoudre d'appeller les
Catholiques à ſon ſecours n'y de revoquer ſon Edit por le quel il
leur avoit fait des defenſes de s'y preſenter: Il aſſeure de plus tous
les bons ſujets que bien qu' il euſt regard aux perſonnes des Catholiques
qui l'avoient ſecouru dans ſa Neceſſité &amp; qu' il euſt
bonne Memoire de leur Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, il ne feroit pourtant jamais rien en faveur de
leur Religion, &amp;c.</hi> All this came too late for our purpoſe; yet if
this, and his Manifeſto at the beginning of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery; if his Letters to the Queen taken at
<hi>Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> wherein he proteſts to differ in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from her but
Religion; if his other Conferences with the Marqueſs of
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61249:78"/> &amp;c. and his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
his Dying Speech will not ſatisfy Men, that he was no Papiſt; they ſeem
to be as Cruel to his Memory as they were to his Perſon: Though after all,
his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Mariage were too Frank for a Church-of-England-Man, who was
not in Love at the ſame time: And the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, if either,
might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, have had ſomewhat a better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, for this Reaſon
only, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was going down the wind, whereas the
<hi>French</hi> King was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; and I muſt repeat it, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of what his Brother of <hi>France, Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, was doing but
juſt on t'other ſide of the Water, increas'd our Jealouſies on this, and
gave an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Wound to the King's Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This made the People, with
ſome colour of Reaſon, by way of prevention, endeavour to wreſt the Sword
out of the King's Hands, and attempt to get the Militia into their own; upon
this pretence the Parliament were forward to put a falſe Conſtruction upon
his Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Forces, and turn'd it to a Levying of War on the People, in
order (as they call'd it) to ſubvert the Laws, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an Arbitrary
Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; whereas we have the King's
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61249:79"/> Word for it, <hi>That he took up Arms only
to Defend the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom;</hi> and in his Dying-Speech he
tells the World, <hi>He did never intend to incroach upon the Privileges of the
People, and that he deſired their Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as much as any body
whatſoever; and that he died a Martyr of the People,</hi> meaning, I
ſuppoſe, for them. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, theſe Proceedings are ſo
unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, that they can't be reconciled to any Rules of Political
Obſervation; there ſeems to be ſomewhat of Fate in them, which will not
be confined to our little narrow ways of Reaſoning, nor to the more enlarged
deep Politicks of Stateſmen. The Event exceeded the Scheme laid by
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> and the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of his Succeſſor
<hi>Mazarine;</hi> who at firſt, being ſurpriz'd, did proſecute the
King's Death with ſome Reſentment, though after (like a true Politician) he
kept Correſpondence with <hi>Cromwell.</hi> It ſeems their deſign was
only to Embroil <hi>England,</hi> whilſt <hi>France</hi> carried on its
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns elſewhere; not to Eſtabliſh any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Power, not a
Commonwealth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Their Buſineſs was but to Embaraſs our Councels,
that they might be at liberty to followitheirs without Interruption. Not to
Eſtabliſh any Religion, not even Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61249:79"/> for even Religion was not their
Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it could have procured Peace and Proſperity to the Kingdom:
But only to Counterpoiſe the two Extremes of Popery and Fanaticiſm (after
the manner of King <hi>James)</hi> for a while, and to ſet the Fanaticks
themſelves by the Ears at laſt. Thus their Correſpondents, their Agents,
and their Money, was employed on all Hands to confound us in <hi>England,</hi>
as well as the Jeſuits had done all <hi>Europe</hi> by their Intriegues
before, and we muſt fatally run into their Nooſe.</p>
               <p>But there yet farther ſeems to be ſome extraordinary Hand in
the Turn of theſe Affairs, above the Common Councels or Actions of Man,
though not to be adjuſted to Human Meaſures of Comprehenſion. Who knows
what to ſay to the Prophecy of <hi>Noſtredamus,</hi> (ſetting aſide the

of</hi> London <hi>ſhall put their King to Death?</hi> 'Tis ſo very
peculiar, though Printed almoſt an Hundred Years before, that it muſt

Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes which determined the Year of his Life, and even the Queen's own
Dream that the King was Stabbing with a Knife, (to paſs by all others
relating to this and other Occaſions) muſt import this at leaſt, to uſe
<hi>Mezeray</hi>'s own Words (who, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was no more Superſtitious this
way than my ſelf) <hi>That there is a Sovereign Power which Diſpoſes of
Futurity, ſince it ſo certainly Knows and Foretels it.</hi> But this
Subject is not my Part. Nevertheleſs, in truth, there appears to have been
ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Conjunctions of the Planets, or ſomething more
Extraordinary which gave that extravagant Turn to Powers here below, not only
in <hi>Europe,</hi> but other remote parts of the World, and put ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Motions in ſuch a Ferment about theſe Times, as was evident in the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland, Spain, Germany,
France, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Hurly-burlies and
Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions there, and in ſeveral other Parts; but alſo between the
<hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and in the Empire of the Great
<hi>Mogul,</hi> between <hi>Cha-gehan</hi> and his Four Sons, eſpecially
<hi>Aureng-zeb;</hi> the Story whereof is Famous, and you may Read it at large
in <hi>Tavernier:</hi> Which <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple</hi>
calls a Fanatick, and compares

<hi>Turk.</hi> But to return to take my leave of King <hi>Charles;</hi> Morally
ſpeaking, I think the Queen was the Chief Occaſion of all thoſe
Misfortunes which attended Him and the Nation, for there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the
Welfare of a Kingdom ſhould hang at a King's Codpiece. The King's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a

                  <hi>CHARLES</hi> II.</head>
               <p>AS to the firſt Twelve Years of the Nominal Reign of this
King, 'twas ſuch a Farce of Policy and Government, that it Libels the
Chronicle; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had been ſooner in his Throne, if he had never
made a Step to help himſelf, by the Diſturbance of thoſe who uſurp'd
his Place. I wiſh for his Honour in the beginning, he had not intermedled
with the Action of <hi>Montroſs</hi> during the Treaty with the
<hi>Scots;</hi> it reflected ſome Aſperſion upon his Sincerity, and he
only ſacrificed one Friend's Life, and the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of others, and thereby
prejudiced his own Intereſt for the preſent. But I know that Buſineſs
hath alſo another Face, and therefore I paſs by that, and ſome other
Occurrences, to proceed to his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration after he was Crowned in
<hi>England:</hi> Which I ſhall touch but very ſlightly neither, as
ſlightly as he did the Intereſts of the Nation; the Hiſtory of theſe
Times being freſh in every one's Memory, I am very much at a loſs
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61249:81"/> (conſidering the different Opinions of
him, and his Inconſiſtency with himſelf) with what Character to introduce
this King to his Government. If he was a Proteſtant when he came over to Us,
as all his fine Declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> import, ſurely the Devil ow'd
Us a ſhame (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Expreſſion) that we ſhould blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on a
Popiſh Match again at firſt daſh: Here was a looſe given to the
Papiſt and Fanatick to play their Old Game over again, and he put himſelf
under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Suſpition with his People once more: For let a
Prince make what Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Speeches he pleaſes, his Actions will be always
more ſignificant, and ſpeak plainer than his Declarations: Hence this
Dilemma became entailed; either he doth anſwer the Expectations of the
Papiſts or not: If he doth, and gives them any Aſſurances,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> his own People are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Skirts: If not, then he is
attack'd by the Indefatigable Plots and Attempts of the Jeſuits, and that
Party.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, in what a bleſſed Condition of Settlement
is a Nation? It can never be at quiet. I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to dive into the
Myſteries of one Plot or t'other, let them ſtand on their own Bottom in the
validity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61249:82"/> No doubt there always hath been a Popiſh
Plot of one ſort or other (more or leſs, as our Kings have given them a
helping hand) ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, I believe, ever will be, ſo
long at leaſt as our Kings manage Affairs as they did for the Four laſt
Reigns: And for ought I know too there may have been a Fanatick Plot ever
ſince <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, time, and will continue as long as Kingly Government
and Church-Hierarchy are in faſhion. Neither ſhall I trouble my ſelf to
enquire which Plot was the Agreſſor, which Plaintiff, which Defendant;
which the Original, and which the Counter-plot: But between them both, this
King had reduced himſelf to a pretty Condition of Trouble, if any thing could
be ſo to him, by his Trimming, (a Quality which was ſcouted in the
Subject): For in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot he was to be taken off, for not being a
Papiſt, or at leaſt for not coming up to their Expectations of him; and by
the Fanatick Plot he was to be Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſs'd and deſtroy'd for being a
Papiſt, and favouring their Deſigns too much: But to determine the
precedence of theſe Plots: I think the Popiſh Plot firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon
the Stage againſt him, and it is thought; attended him at his <hi>Exit,</hi>
though he died of their own Perſuaſion:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61249:82"/> I mean the Popiſh was the firſt Plot of
Quality; for I take no notice of ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Things, as the Extravagant
Matter of <hi>Venner,</hi> or that in the <hi>North,</hi> which was but a
Fag-end of that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſcarce then ſetled; nor of any
thing of that nature which happen'd before the Year 1670. I do not find any
Plot of Conſequence till after the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt
Diſſenters; not taking notice of the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> or that
againſt Quakers; but not till after that againſt Diſſenting Preachers
in Corporations, that againſt Conventicles, which came after the Declaration
for Liberty of Conſcience, and, as far as I can ſee, without any great
provocation; which Acts, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſpeak, were grounded chiefly
on Surmiſe and Suſpition. Thus was he fain to ſhuffle on, ſometimes in
the form of Perſecution againſt Diſſenters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in that of
Toleration and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to them and their Tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; ſo that
Religion grew a meer State-Weather Cock, as Circumſtances hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and
turn'd as Court Cabals mov'd, now one way, now another. Whereas, if he had come
over a True Church-of-England Man, as he pretended to profeſs himſelf; he
might have reduced the Church eaſily enough to ſome degree of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61249:83"/> Uniformity, and modell'd the Civil
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Eccleſiaſtical State, to a good Temper, having the
Military Power in his own hands by the Militia Acts. But I ſuppoſe that was
not his Buſineſs. And he diſcover'd the ſame Unſteadineſs in Civil
Matters; ſhifting Miniſters and Officers, Proroguing and Diſſolving
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments without apparent Reaſons; and, 'tis ſaid, for very bad Ones
ſometimes, and at very Evil Inſtances alſo. 'Twas the ſame thing in
Military Affairs; Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Armies to take the Air, and then Disbanding them
abruptly; ſometimes with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and then with the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt the <hi>French;</hi> ſo
Unconſtant and Variable in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Himſelf: In truth he did not
love to be tied to any thing, not even to a Miſtreſs; and as very fond as
he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be of Parliaments once, he found Expedients, if they did not
preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſhake hands with them (after that long one that
he was almoſt married to) very lightly ſhook them off as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
Monitors; and, I believe, would have liked a Triennial Wife much better than a
Triennial Parliament: And 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pity, that his firſt Choice was made
by him (or rather for him) that he had not had an Opportunity of Wedding once
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61249:83"/> more, to have tried if he or they could
have made a more improper Choice. In ſhort, his Court and his Camp were a
Jeſt, I had almoſt ſaid his Church too; So far on Civil Suppoſition
that he was a Proteſtant: But Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in his
<hi>Memoires,</hi> ſcurvily intimates, That he was a Papiſt, and had a
Deſign of ſetting up the ſame Religion and Government here, as that in
<hi>France;</hi> and that he had his Pentionary Miniſters and Cabals for that
purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I'm ſorry if this was the only thing he was
ſerious in! If this be true, he failed in his Deſigns, and ſhew'd
himſelf no more a good Politician, than a good King: For whereas (as 'tis
ſaid) he might have given Laws to his Neighbours, by a well-grounded Peace or
War; he was impoſed upon to take them from them; and was nothing at Home, as
<hi>Gourvile,</hi> (who is ſaid to be the ſoundeſt <hi>French-Head)</hi>
obſerved, reflecting on him; <hi>Qu'un Roy d' Angleterre qui veut eſtre l'
hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me de ſon peuple, eſt le plus Grand Roy du Monde; mais s'il veut
eſtre quelque choſe d'advantage, par Dieu, il n'eſt plus rien.</hi> 'Twas
boldly expoſtulated by Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> and well anſwered by
the King; <hi>Et je veux eſtre l'Homme de mon peuple,</hi> if he could have
held to it, as well as ſaid it: But there was ſomething elſe behind, or
within the Curtain: However this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61249:84"/> was, it ſeems, the King had managed his
Affairs ſo, that he had no more Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for his Sincerity Abroad, than he
had at Home: The States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
himſelf, had his Miniſters and him in ſuſpition, and his own Faction or
Cabal divided againſt him, as knowing he was not to be depended upon; and the
Parliament it ſelf alſo had him in Jealouſy: What a Figure is ſuch a
King like to make, when he and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment encounter one another with
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Tricks! And when his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Liberty of Conſcience gave
more Offence, than his giving of it! He was, beſides, thought ſomewhat too
much addicted to Pleaſures, to apply himſelf to any thing ſerious: Not
that, I think, thoſe Reliefs are to be diſallow'd: No man would be a King,
if he were not to be allowed to ſoften his Cares with Diverſions, and to
ſweeten them with Advantages of Delights; but he ought not, certainly, to
ſuffer them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the Publick Conſultations, and Claſh with
the Conſiderations of the Welfare of his People: And this is ſaid to be his
fault. He was ſo much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Softneſs, that he abhorr'd Application
and Buſineſs; but, perhaps, he had other Reaſons, beſides, againſt
too much Intenſeneſs of Thought and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61249:84"/> He might have the Succeſs of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, as then Conſtituted, no more in his Wiſhes,
than his Thoughts; Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> hath an Unhappy Obſervation
this way, which I doubt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>I have obſerved from all that I have ſeen, or heard, or
read in Story, That nothing is ſo fallacious, as to Reaſon upon the
Councels or Conduct of Princes or States, from what one conceives to be the
true Intereſt of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for there is in all Places an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of thoſe that Govern, and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe that are Governed: (Hard
Saying!) And therefore I could never find a better way of judging the
Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a State, than by the Perſonal Temper, Underſtanding, or
Paſſions, or Humours of the Princes, or Chief Miniſters that were for
that time at the head of Affairs.</q> 'Tis true, he gives the King a very
handſome Character af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; but 'tis ſuch a one, that ſeems to be
reſtrained to his Private and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, not his Publick or Politick
Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; as if a very fine Gentleman were ſpoiled, to make a very
Indifferent King: And certainly he had more Vertues one way than t'other. I do
not think he was Covetous; but I can't commend his Liberality, in being
Generous at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61249:85"/> of others, and free of his Subjects
Purſes: Thus he had rather be at the charges of a Pentionary Parliament, than
at the pains of treating Fairly and Above-board. I ſhall not engage with the
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this Court, they are too much a Myſtery for me to dive into: Only
I ſhall infer this Political Obſervation, That the Affairs of this Nation
have never gone well, when the Councels of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have been very much an
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: They ought to be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, than too much expos'd: But
there is One thing the People always will expect to be made privy to, that is,
the Application of Money given; for if it come from them, they will always, and
with Reaſon, know the Occaſion; and will not endure to ſee it
miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: Eſpecially as the Circumſtances of the Revenue then ſtood,
his Income was certainly known, though I do not think the ſtate of it was
alter'd for the better in all Reſpects: The King had loſt ſome Privileges
in parting with thoſe Commanding-Tenures; and though his Revenues might be
thought aſcertain'd, yet if it were not precarious, 'twas ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what odious,
and to be improv'd by the Debaucheries and Vices of his People. Hence; and by
the Example of the Court, the Nation began to be Lewd,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61249:85"/> Headſtrong and Diſſolute: Laws of
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Frugality, and Good Manners, were let looſe, and the Execution
of them became in a little time a Jeſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as Politicks and
Morality were at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Whitehall.</hi> A new Scheme of
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was to be contriv'd, and new Methods of Adminiſtration, and new
Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Loyalty ſet up: A Man was not to Conſider or Reflect, on
pain of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a <hi>Whigg</hi> or <hi>Trimmer;</hi> Names of
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the two Extremes. <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Whigg</hi> were
maliciouſly contriv'd by way of Reproach; and what was worſe, that he might
be ſure to go with the Court-Tide and Stream, the Moderate Character was
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the worſt of all: We were not by any means to reaſon on
Government, but 'twas required that we ſhould wink, or be blind, and
implicitly ſubmit our Underſtandings to Patriarchal and Arbitrary Doctrines
and Examples, to prepare Us for what was to follow. Such were our Kings, ſuch
our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and ſuch were the People to be. But all theſe Kings of
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Line ſeem to have differ'd in their Ideas and Methods of
Government. King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſed upon it;
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt Reaſon'd on it (with too much
<hi>Opiniatretie),</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second Banter'd it; and
I'm ſure King <hi>James</hi> the Second did not Moralize upon it.</p>

pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted One upon a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> for having ſaid ſo

if the firſt dyed ſuch, I can't but believe he had lived one for Thirty
Years at leaſt; and they will both ſtand in need of a very great
Diſpenſation ſomewhere elſe, for their Hypocriſy ſo many Years. If
King <hi>Charles</hi> believ'd nothing of the Popiſh
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61249:86"/> Plot (as is ſaid) I know not whether it
will diminiſh the Credit of it: But 'tis certain his Succeſſor King
<hi>James</hi> abundantly confirm'd its Credibility, even ſo much as to give

Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then ran ſo high, that they were not willing to part with him
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Experience; nor then neither, it ſeems, by ſome; vainly imagining,
that the Honour of a Popiſh King could ſuperſede, and take place of his
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Books and Pamphlets of that Seaſon, have ſufficiently
expoſed or demonſtrated the Character of this King, and the Principles of
that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And 'twas as Evident to any body that would ſee what he had
been doing in his Brother's Reign, as what he did in his own. Whether we
conclude his Practice from his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or his Principles from his
Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, there's enough to convince for the paſt, and to caution for the
time to come. If Declarations repeated with ſo much Solemnity, and broke

Judges, whom the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> made ſolemnly to take an Oath that

ſupplied as <hi>Magdalen-College.</hi> But it happen'd very luckily for
<hi>England,</hi> that King <hi>James</hi> diſcover'd his Temper of Spirit a
little too ſoon. We all knew of what force Edicts-had been in
<hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Copies whereof our Kings had been
ſo apt to follow; and what the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had been doing in the
Valleys of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but we would not believe King <hi>James</hi> was
Cruel, was a Perſecutor, ſcarce that he was a Papiſt, becauſe he had
the Art to Conceal and Diſguiſe himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, before it was in his

Character, as they would have had him deceiv'd us by another. He was pleaſed
for ſome Conſiderations (whether of Fear or Guilt) to leave us abruptly,
and we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that Advantage of parting with him fairly: And I wiſh him
all the Happineſs that is conſiſtent with the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of
<hi>England.</hi> Only let us as <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> remember, That we now
have an Act of Parliament of our ſide, which Aſſerts the Rights and
Liberties of the Subject, and hath Eſtabliſh'd the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
Crown; and which inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates any Papiſt, or Perſon Marrying a Papiſt,
from having and enjoying it; which Act is only Defective in this, That it is
not Order'd to be <hi>Read in the Churches twice at leaſt every Year, and
upon Penalty of Deprivation.</hi> If ſuch a Law had been made in
<hi>Edward</hi> the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>'s Time, it might have ſav'd ſome Blood and
Trouble ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

               <p>THE Lord Chancellor <hi>Notttingham</hi> in the Caſe of the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Charles Howard</hi> Eſquire,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath, in my Mind, a notable Expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Pray let us ſo Reſolve Caſes here, that they may ſtand
with the Reaſon of Mankind when they are Debated abroad.</q> Shall that be
Reaſon here, that is not Reaſon in any part of the World beſides? In
truth, we are apt to be peculiarly Artificial in our Thoughts and way of
Argument, and our Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are too Municipal. Thus every little Pedant can
Settle and Eſtabliſh the Affairs of Religion and Government, and can
Reſolve all the great Myſteries of Church and State (as he thinks) in his
narrow Study. But if a Man looks Abroad, and takes a general ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the
World, and reflects upon the Univerſal Notions and Cuſtoms of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, his
Soul will become more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and will not determine ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially
upon the Principles of any particular Sect or Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61249:89"/> The Caſe of King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> in it
ſelf, is, perhaps, the moſt Glorious and Generous Cauſe that hath
appeared upon the Stage of Human Actions; yet hath been ſullied by dire
Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by poor-ſpirited and precarious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which have
been brought in for its ſupport. His Title to the Crown of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> ſtands Firm, and is juſtifiable upon Natural and Sound
foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Reaſon, without Props: But hath been ſo oddly maintained by
the manner of its Defence, that it hath been the Juſtification only that hath
Diſgrac'd the Revolution: <hi>Doctrina facit Difficulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> We have
been running out of the way to fetch in Aids from Art and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whilſt
Nature preſents us with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and undefiled Principles of Reaſon. Thus
the King's Acceſſion to the Throne hath been introduced by ſhuffling
between Providential Settlement, Conqueſt, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, Abdication, and
topping Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Power; whilſt Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and People of Honeſt
Plain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, ſtand Amazed, inſtead of being Convinced; and hang
back when Allegiance comes to be explained, and a Recognition demanded; an
Aſſociation propoſed, frights us as a thing ſtrange and impious; which
ſhews our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61249:90"/> was not rightly founded, but looks like a
thing of Fancy, built upon a forc'd and fictitious bottom. All theſe

                  <hi>Johnſon,</hi>
except only <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication;</hi> which, with ſubmiſſion, is alſo too
Artificial; a Word not to be found in the Alphabet of <hi>Spelman;</hi> a Civil
Law Term (uſed almoſt in Fifty ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſes) and therefore an
uncouth Expreſſion of the Common Laws of this Realm to ſpeak in: The Word

Senſe of King <hi>James</hi> the I<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> his Speech to his Parliament,
<hi>viz. A ſettled King is bound to obſerve the Paction made to his People
by his Laws, in framing his Government agreeable thereunto: And a King
Governing in a ſettled Kingdom,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61249:90"/> 
                  <hi>leaves to be a King, and degenerates
into a</hi> Tyrant, <hi>as ſoon as he leaves off Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the
Laws.</hi> In which Caſe the King's Conſcience may ſpeak to him (as the
Poor Widow ſaid to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,)</hi> Either Govern
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Law, <hi>aut ne ſis Rex:</hi> And if a Subject's
Conſcience may not ſpeak the ſame thing, King <hi>James</hi>'s Words
ſignify nothing. The other Words car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an Odious or ſuſpected
Conſtruction in them; the Firſt (in the Convocation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle) implies Guilt,
and at beſt creates but a <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Allegiance; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is
a Jeſt, and falſe in Fact, beſides 'tis what the King himſelf
diſowns; the Third is an idle Sham, as ſtated; and the Fourth is alſo a
little ſtrain'd, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve; and we might, for ought I ſee, as well
have call'd it a Ceſſion, eſpecially if King <hi>James</hi> was a
Spiritual Perſon of the Society of Jeſuits, as hath been ſaid. But what
need we any Term of Art? Let the matter expreſs it ſelf by Periphraſis in
its own genuine Phraſe. It is fairly ſtated in the Prince's Declaration:
And our Caſe is no more nor leſs than this; A King, contrary to his
Coronation-Oath, diſpenſes with, and breaks through all the Eſtabliſhed
Laws of the Land, Invades and Subverts the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of
the People, which he Swore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61249:91"/> to maintain inviolably; and Diſſolves
the Conſtitution of Church and State in an Arbitrary Tyrannical manner; the
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therefore in Defence of their Laws, Rights, and Religion, and the
neceſſary Preſervation of them, Oppoſe the violent proceedings of
ſuch a Prince (I put the Caſe at the worſt) and alſo apply
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Neighbouring Prince, (who hath an Expectation of a Right to
the Crown), and pray in Aid of him to aſſiſt them in the Maintaining and
Defending their Legal Rights, together with his own Title to the
Succeſſion; who, in his own Words, makes Preparation to Aſſiſt the
People againſt the Subverters of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Laws, and alſo Invites
and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all Perſons whatſoever,
<q>All the Peers of the Realm, Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and all
Gentlemen, Citizens, and other Commons of all Ranks, to come and aſſiſt
him in order to the Execution of this Deſign, againſt all ſuch as ſhall
endeavour to Oppoſe them, to prevent all thoſe Miſeries which muſt
needs fall upon the Nations being kept under Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government and Slavery;
and that all the Violences and Diſorders which have overturn'd the whole
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, may be fully
Redreſſed in a Free and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Parliament, to ſecure the Nation
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61249:91"/> from relapſing into the Miſeries of
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government any more.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which appearance of mutual Defence
for Self-preſervation, the Conſcious King Retires, firſt leaves his Army,
(which no Man I will be bold to ſay would do without Guilt or Cowardice, and
I'm ſure a Prince that had been Brave, or acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Principles of Honour,
would have Fought it out with but Ten Regiments, or with One at his Heels,
which was <hi>Richard</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>'s Caſe in the firſt ſence, though
not in the later) and after leaves the Realm, for Reaſons beſt known to
himſelf (whether Frighted, or not, is not material) upon which, the Prince,
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Conſort, the next Heir (Indiſputable) to the Crown, in a
full and due Repreſentation of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and Body of the Kingdom,
is and are Declared and Appointed King and Queen.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what we have done upon the whole matter, to
deſerve that harſh Language of the Convocation-Book, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Sherlock;</hi> Whether we have done more, or ſo much as all other
Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have done in a Caſe any thing like Ours? Whether we have done more
than becomes Good Chriſtians, or Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? And what it is that ſtands
in our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61249:92"/> way to hinder or bar ſuch an Attempt and
Action?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Setting aſide at preſent thoſe Texts of St.
<hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which are the only diſcouraging
Impediments, and which have been ſufficiently, as I think, anſwered and
avoided by ſeveral Pens: Upon the Law of Nature, no Man, I believe, can
pretend to ſay, here is any Natural Injuſtice, or Moral Injury done;
Certainly Nature and Reaſon prompt us to Defend Injuries, and to Repel Force;
Nature will preſerve it ſelf in its Being. No Man will ſay a King of
<hi>England</hi> hath power of Life and Death over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (We ſay he
hath no Power, other than by the Law of the Land); the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as well as Legal
Conſequence muſt be, That we may Defend our Lives againſt all
Aſſaults; 'tis the ſame of Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; for there is a
<hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> in all Chriſtian Commonwealths, as
Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> ſaid before, ſubject only to the Laws of the
Place; therefore I can't defend my ſelf or Houſe againſt the King Arm'd
with Legal Power, as upon a <hi>Cap. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tlaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or upon a Duty due to
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I may, where I am out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a Legal
Proſecution. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Self-defence and Preſervation be
denied, it's vain trifling to talk of Laws,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61249:92"/> and to value our ſelves upon Living in a
Country where the Meaſures of Right are aſcertain'd, and the Limits of
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Subjection; the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> and
the <hi>Bow String,</hi> will be the ſame, if Laws are only a ſimple
Direction for Information, and not an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. We muſt owe our Lives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> at this rate, to Fortune, not to Juſtice: But ſince the
Reſtoration, it's ſaid we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Tie not to take up Arms, by
the Extravagant Compliment to King <hi>Charles</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the
Declaration pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to that Act. Be it ſo; though all Laws made in
Extraordinary Heats are not a regular Obligation; but let them take that
State-Artificial Obligation into the Bargain; the King Swears too, and this was
not deſigned to let looſe the King's Hands, and tie the Subjects; for all
Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, whether Natural or Artificial, are Reciprocal and Mutual, and
always ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and underſtood in common Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There can be no
other Notion of Juſtice, Natural, Moral, or Political; and whatever
Preference and Advantage is allowed to One above the Other, 'tis an Authority
upon Suppoſition of Care, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and for Order, and centers in the Good
of the Community. And, I think, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a Law to
Puniſh Parents who did not their Duty towards
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61249:93"/> their Children. Let us therefore take in
the higheſt Inſtance of Obedience and Duty from Children to Parents: No
Man, I ſuppoſe, will pretend now, that a Father may Caſtrate, Sell, or
Kill a Child; the Inference muſt be, That in any Caſe of ſuch open
Violence, a Son may Reſiſt a Father, in his own neceſſary Defence and
Self-preſervation (without offering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Injury, or Vindictive Force):
So in the Caſe of Lunacy in a Parent, or any fatal Extravagance, no doubt a
Son may lay Hands on a Father by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and muſt take a
continued Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Care over him, in caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This is agreed on all hands to be the ſevereſt Tie of Obedience; and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings are endeavoured to be brought within the Fifth Commandment to
make our Chains the faſter; not in the mean time conſidering that they make
them looſer, by putting an inconſiſtent double Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Thus we are
told Religion ſtands poſitively in our way, and fetters us with an
Abſolute Obedience to Kings without Reſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeems
hard that Religion ſhould weaken our Arm in Defence of it ſelf, and force
our Obedience and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Laws and Abſolute Power in the ſame
breath: For where there is Abſolute Power, there is no Law; and where there
are Laws, there is no Abſolute Power.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61249:93"/> But Scripture is to be our Guide; I agree
it: But what Authority ſhall I rely on? Where ſhall I apply my ſelf for
an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter? 'Tis manifeſt our own Church cannot ſettle me, that is
divided againſt it ſelf. Some bring Inſtances from the Old Teſtament;
Others tell us, That is nothing to the purpoſe, thoſe Kings being by God's
Deſignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some tell us, theſe Texts of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> oblige us to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience on
peril of Damnation: And Others as boldly and magiſterially inform us, That
the New Teſtament gives no Rules for Submiſſion to Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only Rules of Juſtice, Order, and Peace; That thoſe Texts are nothing
to Our purpoſe; for the Apoſtles ſpoke to thoſe under Heathen Emperors,
where <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was Eſtabliſhed by a Law; and that thoſe Texts
are to be only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
themſelves under the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and thought they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Subjects of any other Power. As to the Scripture-Examples, we are Taught by
a very great Divine and Biſhop, not to rely on them; and he ſays, Thoſe
who place the Obligatory Nature of theſe Examples from Scripture, muſt
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produce the Moral Nature of thoſe Examples, or elſe a Rule binding
us to follow thoſe Examples, eſpecially when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61249:94"/> theſe Examples are brought to found a New
poſitive Law Obliging all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Some ſay in general, the Bible is
a Miſcellaneous Book, where Diſhoneſt and Time-ſerving Men may ever, in
their looſe way, find a Text for their purpoſe. Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>
upon the Diſpute of the Form of Powers (for theſe Texts are ſometimes
applied to the Form, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Quality of Power) takes Power only
in the Singular Number; Powers in the Plural is a damnable Sin; and he will
have all Governments but the Patriarchal, to be Illegal and Abominable; but
this is ſo Extravagant, that, I think, none of our Divines pretend to
juſtify him in it; and therefore Others, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are of Opinion,
That Submit to all Powers, infers, That all Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are admitted
to be good, and do not allow that <hi>Power</hi> in the Singular is to be taken
reſtrictive, and ſo there is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if not of God, and the
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are (of God's Inſtitution) are ordered under God. Sir
<hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hicks,</hi> &amp;c. will have the Legiſlative
Power to be in the King alone. And the Firſt ſays, all Legiſlative Powers
are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary; But where is the neceſſity for that? And D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hicks</hi>
ſays alſo, Only the Laws of Men are God's Ordinances: St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
ſpeaking of Authority in general, ſays,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61249:94"/> 
                  <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons adminiſtring Authority, calls
it, the <hi>Ordinance of Man;</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> upon that,
<hi>Render unto Ceſar, the things that are Ceſars, and unto God the things
that are God's,</hi> divides all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the King, and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the poor Subject; which doth not very well conſiſt with our Saviour's
Advice to him, whom he bid <hi>Sell All that he had, and give to the poor,</hi>
which grieved the Young Man, for <hi>he had Great poſſeſſions.</hi> It
ſeems by this our Saviour implies the Subject had Property, otherwiſe he
could not have Sold it. Thus they make their own Idol.</p>
               <p>We ſee then by the better Opinions of Divines and Learned Men,
all Forms of Power are Authentick, with reſpect to the Laws and
Conſtitutions of Places; <hi>and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all Powers,</hi> imports only
Obedience according to Law, the Ordinance of Man; <hi>To render unto
Ceſar,</hi> &amp;c. implies certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſomething was left in him who
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: It is not ſaid, Give all to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> So no Man will
controvert the <hi>ſubmitting to every ordinance,</hi> with the Context; for
Rulers are a Terror to the Evil, and not to the Good. There never was any King
in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but had ſome Engagement and Tye upon him, Formally with
God, or by Covenant with Man: To keep the Laws, to judge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61249:95"/> to ſeek the Good of the People,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, the Caſe of the Apoſtles is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
different in all reſpects: As to Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Government
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors was Abſolute (taking it at worſt) and
therefore Chriſtians, who had no Law on their ſide, could not reſiſt:
(This is ſaid by ſome, tho' our Saviour does not ſeem to mean it ſo);
whereas Ours under our Kings is limited and mixt; therefore not the ſame
foundation to apply the Injunctions of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance from the Apoſtles.
As to Religion, the Apoſtles came counter to all Laws, and therefore were to
ſubmit to them: Not to raiſe Rebellion on account of a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which
had no foundation in any Law: And the proper Talent and Buſineſs of the
Apoſtles was ſuffering for the ſake of the Goſpel; therefore
impertinent as well as prophane and wicked for them, to think of reſiſting
any Powers. What is this to the maintaining a Religion eſtabliſhed by a
Law? But this Conſtruction impoſed upon Us towards Paſſive Obedience,
is a Conceit againſt the Opinion of moſt Learned Men, and alſo contrary
to the Common Practiſe of the Chriſtian World. <hi>Grotius, Selden,</hi>
&amp;c. underſtand <hi>ſubmiſſion to every ordinance,</hi> to be to the
Government, and the Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And ſo in common conſtruction and
intendment, thoſe Texts may be taken a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Apoſtles to
their Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61249:95"/> and Correſpondents, who were to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
through variety of Governments to pay all Duties and Civil Reſpects to Kings
and Magiſtrates, and may be ſatisfied with that particular application of
Obedience: They were enjoined not to enquire into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Rights of
Power, but to take them as they found them, being only Powers of this World,
with proper Laws for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind in Peace and Order in general, according
to the Reſpective Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions. I believe beſides, the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is an Univerſal Inſtruction for Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws, on the
ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſobedience to them: 'Twas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make
them good Subjects, but not Slaves. 'Tis too much to be Paſſive and Martyrs
by whole Nations, with the Laws and Religion bleeding by our Sides. Let's look
into the Cuſtoms and Uſages of other Ages and Places, and enquire into, and
examine the Principles and Opinions of Learned Divines on the Occaſions of
Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Exerciſe or Abuſe of it. If a man ſhould conſult the
Hiſtories of the firſt Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> both
before and ſince thoſe Nations receiv'd the Light of the Goſpel, and the
hudled abrupt Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beſides the very odd Partnerſhips in
Kingdoms; he will find matter but of ſmall Veneration for Titles to Crowns of
Old Times, whatever he may fancy is due to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61249:96"/> the Preſent Eſtabliſhments: And I
doubt we ſhould diſcover but a faint blind Track of Active Providence in
the transferring Kingdoms (as 'tis call'd) but only rather the Effects of a
Ludicrous Fortune. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we ſhould be free, and tell the World we have
Elected, Made, or Appointed (call it what you will) King <hi>William</hi> King
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> inſtead of King <hi>James</hi> (without the
formality of Depoſing, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off his Crown or Head, to make a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
or without the <hi>Ens Rationis</hi> of a Vacancy); it would be no more than
what may be juſtified by Precedents of no Bad Times in other Countries, and
our Own too. In <hi>France,</hi> the Inſtance of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
degraded, and <hi>Aegidius</hi> or <hi>Gillon,</hi> Maſter of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Militia (who was a Stranger, but in Reputation for Probity and
Wiſdom) Elected in his ſtead. It is ſaid, the <hi>French,</hi> according
to their Ancient Rights, conferr'd upon <hi>Pepin</hi> (after <hi>Thierry</hi>
was ſtripp'd of his Royalty) the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Auſtraſia:</hi> And
afterwards <hi>Pepin</hi> his Grandſon (Son of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> and
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Charlemain)</hi> by a Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled was appointed
King, although there was One of the <hi>Marovignian</hi> Race remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but
Young, Stupid, and Witleſs: And for the Honour of the Church, Pope
<hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> confirm'd him: Upon which, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliament at
<hi>Roymes,</hi> they degraded
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61249:96"/> 
                  <hi>Childerick,</hi> and Elected
<hi>Pepin:</hi> And the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz, Boniface,</hi> declared to
them the Validity of the Pope's Anſwer. And after, at the Aſſembly at
<hi>Carbonnat,</hi> the <hi>Auſtraſian</hi> Lords and Eſtates
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Charlemain</hi> their King. They might do, ſays the
Hiſtory, this, and if he had not had That Right, he had been an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
for the Children of <hi>Charlemain</hi> were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>'s
beſt, if not only Title, was Election: For <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> was of the <hi>Carolovinian</hi> Race, and Heir, but, as is
ſaid, of little merit.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Viſigoths</hi> (about 1200 years
ſince) made and unmade their Kings as they pleas'd. I ſuppoſe 'twill not
be ſaid They were the worſe Chriſtians for being nearer the time of our
Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>So it was in <hi>Denmark</hi> too, till they lately changed from
Elective to Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from a Limited to an Abſolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo,
for ought we know, it may again, when that Arbitrary Power hath had its full
ſwing.</p>
               <p>To look back here at home; formerly it was ſo. And I know not
why we may not be permitted to go upwards as far as we pleaſe, ſince
thoſe on t'other ſide think fit to go backward to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third
for the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61249:97"/> beginning, as they ſay, of our
Conſtitution. <hi>Egbert</hi> the Firſt, ſole <hi>Saxon</hi> King, upon
the Report of the Death of <hi>Britric,</hi> with great ſpeed returned out of
<hi>France,</hi> where, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his abode, he had ſerv'd with
good Commendation in the Wars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Charles the Great;</hi> by means
whereof, his Reputation encreaſing amongſt his own Countrymen, he was
thought worthy of the Government before he obtained it: And <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>
a Monk, a Deacon, and a Biſhop, yet Elected King, becauſe they could not
find a fitter Perſon for the Crown. <hi>Edwin</hi> by his Miſcarriage
turn'd his Subjects Hearts, and the <hi>Mercians</hi> and
<hi>Northumbrians</hi> revolted, and ſwore Fealty to his Younger Brother
<hi>Edgar.</hi> The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Lords during
their ſhort time of Reign here: <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> by general
Conſent was admitted King: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> choſe himſelf, and raviſh'd
a Crown, and he fared accordingly for his Intruſion without the Conſent of
the People. All that is intended by this ſhort Account, is, only to ſhew,
That Succeſſion was not always eſteemed ſo Sacred; and that
Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hath not been ſo ſtanch'd a Doctrine always, as ſome
now would pretend.</p>
               <p>To come nearer to our preſent Caſe, Let's ſee the Opinion
of Councels and Divines, and perhaps we ſhall not need to be much
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61249:97"/> out of Countenance for aſſiſting the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the Vindication of our Civil Rights and Religion,
and I believe the Church of <hi>England</hi> will ſtand by Us: And Divines of
great Reputation gave their Judgment for Subjects defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt their Princes in Caſes not near ſo ſtrong as Ours.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave Countenance and Aid to the Revolt
of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or Rebellion, as it is call'd, againſt the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and did it by Advice of Learned and Religious Divines,
as Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> &amp;c. And 'twas for the ſake of Religion: Queen
<hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> alſo aſſiſted the Proteſtants in
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> Faction: <hi>Cambden</hi>
ſays, ſhe had a Conſultation about that Matter; and although it was
urged, That it was of Ill Example to patroniſe another Prince's Subjects in
Commotion; yet it ſeem'd to be an Impious thing to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them of the
ſame Religion.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> juſtifies the Defence which the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> made, on ſuppoſition that it was for the
Maintenance of the Laws.</p>
               <p>If we look into the Affair of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> or
Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> we find (tho King <hi>James</hi> was backward, <hi>i.
e.</hi> fearful, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61249:98"/> had not Courage when the War broke out in
<hi>Germany)</hi> the Senſe of the Archbiſhop, in his Letter to Sir
<hi>Robert Naunton,</hi> Secretary of State, when he adviſed the King to
ſend Aid againſt the Emperor's Attempts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing Popery and
Arbitrary Power; he encourages the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> as King of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> by Election, in the matter for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel,
and to protect the Oppreſs'd, and declares for his own part, He did not dare
but give Advice to follow where God leads; apprehending the Work of God in
This, and That of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and that he was ſatisfied in Conſcience
that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had a Juſt Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, who appeared to be of as
Scrupulous a Judgment in the Point as any, By the Advice of Archbiſhop
<hi>Laud,</hi> not only aſſiſted the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> (who
aſſiſted others) againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to keep the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> from overrunning the Weſtern part of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and ſent Forces and Supplies for the Cauſe of
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; as his Reaſons are emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Declaration:
But alſo ſome time after publiſhed a Declaration of War againſt
<hi>France,</hi> chiefly on Account of that King's Proteſtant Subjects, for
Violation of Edicts, and Breach of Articles and Contracts with them. Whereas
Contracts and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at other times with Us have, by ſome,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61249:98"/> been pronounced Prophane Abſurdities,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Revolt of <hi>Catalonia</hi> hath had its due
Repreſentation here as well as elſewhere: The only Reaſon for their
taking up Arms, was, in plain Terms, to rid themſelves of their
Oppreſſors, which the Nobility ſaid was their Duty; and to preſerve
their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form of Government from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> who Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Rich and Poor by Arbitrary Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
Religion was no Ingredient in their Rebellion: Their Acclamations were,
<hi>Long live the new King</hi> D'Juan de Braganza, <hi>and let them dye that
govern ill.</hi> His Acceſſion to the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> was
Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Countenanced by all the Kingdoms and States in
<hi>Europe</hi> upon the Return of his <hi>Manifeſto's;</hi> (only the
Emperor, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was, condemn'd it) the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not
Reſent it. And they congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him upon the Merits, as well as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Attempt.</p>
               <p>Where then is this Ambitious Prince? Where is that Wicked and
Ungodly People, as they call Us? We have done no more than what hath been done
upon a Godly Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in like Caſes; nay not ſo much, and our
Caſe goes farther; for theſe had only Edicts and Acts of Grace to maintain;
We defend our Religion Eſtabliſh'd by the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:61249:99"/> This Family of the <hi>Naſſaus</hi>
have the hardeſt Meaſure under the Sun; To be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Daring and
Ambitious Spirits, and to have Damnation thus Entailed upon them, only for
undertaking the Cauſe of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and Reſcuing Abus'd Innocence
from the Tyranny of Arbitrary and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Power.</p>
               <p>Why then are the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
ſo reſty upon this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? There is ſcarce any Reaſon to be
imagined, unleſs it be for thoſe which they bring themſelves; ſuch as
the Convocation-Settlement, Conqueſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we ſhould
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into their Opinions, and variety of Principles, I doubt we ſhall
find them ſo Un-uniform, that we ſhall never ground any fixt Authority upon
them in this Point, or any other. Tho it ſeems but an Ungrateful Task to
expoſe their Contradictions and Contrarieties in all Ages: But if they have
differ'd amongſt themſelves in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Notions of Obedience,
or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and the Settlement of Crowns, I hope they will give Us
leave in Equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to chuſe which we will follow: In truth, he who
will be at the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Writings, <hi>i. e.</hi> their General
Councels themſelves, even from the firſt Four, to the Laſt, I'm ſorry
to ſay it, will,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61249:99"/> I believe, find but a Sandy Foundation to
fix his Conſcience or Judgment in Articles of Faith. What have they been
doing with the Trinity of late? What have they not been doing to get the
Government into the Church-Conuſance by way of Succeſs and Providence? Tho
I would have this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſetled to ſatisfy and pleaſe every one in
their own way, if it were poſſible, for Men have different Ideas of things:
Yet I'am unwilling the Government ſhould be trick'd and impos'd upon: And
that Men ſhould advance their own Stations and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, by publiſhing
and miſ-applying Notions which expoſe the Church and King both: I muſt
confeſs, I think Dr. <hi>S—</hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Government have been
the greateſt againſt it with all Men of Reaſon and Honour, and have
hindred many from coming into it. What ſtuff have we produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a
Convocation-Book! the greateſt Affront to a King and People that was ever
offer'd with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to the Church. It is ſaid,
<q>Providence may actually, and God will, when he ſees fit, and
can ſerve the Ends of his Providence, ſet up Kings without any Regard to
Legal Right, or Human Laws; and when they are thus ſet up, they are
inveſted with God's Authority, which muſt be obey'd, and this
ſuperſedes all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Diſputes of Right, and our old Oaths and our old
Allegiance are at an end: For
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61249:100"/> when God transfers Kingdoms, and hath
ſet over Us a New King (and ſetled him) and requires our Obedience to a New
King, he neceſſarily transfers our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the
Authority unjuſtly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and wreſted from the True and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Poſſeſſor, being always God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore receiving no
Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Wickedneſs of thoſe that have it, is ever, when any
Alterations are truly ſetled, to be obeyed: </q>Why all this, (tho as with a
ſuppoſing) to Us? It ſeems by this, That the Nobility and Gentry of this
Nation have been bantering God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with Prayers and Praiſes all this
while, whereas both Prince and People, and All of Us, ſhould have been
humbling our ſelves in Sackcloth and Aſhes, and doing Pennance for our
Rebellion and Wickedneſs. I ſhall not trouble a Serious Thought about this
Convocation-Book, or the Occaſion of it; enough hath been ſaid about that
and the Doctor already. King <hi>James</hi> I. in his Letter to Dr.
<hi>Abbot,</hi> ſhews his Reſentment of the Proceedings of that
Convocation. Only I will produce another Convocation, to ſhew how the former
hath ſetled the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The firſt was in the time of <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt, the other in <hi>James</hi> the Second. Now you ſhall ſee the
Judgment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſity of <hi>Oxon:</hi> They in their
Convocation reflecting (as they tell Us)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61249:100"/> upon certain Pernicious Books, and
Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines, <hi>(viz</hi> amongſt others, Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 10.
<q>That Poſſeſſion and Strength give a Right to
Government; and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a Cauſe or Enterprize proclaims it to be Lawful
and Juſt; <hi>(Nota)</hi> To pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it, Is to comply with the Will of God,
becauſe it is to follow the Conduct of his Providence:</q> 
                  <hi>Hobbes, Owen,
Baxter, Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> &amp;c. And Propoſition 15.
<q>If a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who by Oath and Duty are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to a
Sovereign, ſhall ſinfully Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him, and, contrary to their
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, chuſe and covenant with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may be obliged by their
Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, notwithſtanding their Former;</q> 
                  <hi>Baxter, H. C.</hi>
&amp;c.) by their Judgment and Decree, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1683. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced theſe,
amongſt many other ſuch like Propoſitions, Heretical; and Decreed,
Judged, and Declared them to be Falſe, Seditious, and Impious, Blaſphemous
and Infamous to Chriſtian Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all Government in
Church and State: What a Bleſſed Eſtabliſhment is here! What an
Honourable Title hath the King! in what a Condition is the Subject! Thus we
ſee how unſafe 'tis to imply or ſuppoſe a Providential Uſurper, or
King <hi>de facto,</hi> which is all one; and then to ſecure him by Arguments
out of the Clouds. So 'tis of a Forcible Uſurper, or King <hi>de facto,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61249:101"/> t'other way, to Eſtabliſh him with a
Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Succeſs, as Conqueror, without Right: As if we come to
meaſure the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Providence by our narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and
Rules, and tack it to every Succeſs, we ſhall make a very odd Buſineſs
of it, and put Providence upon very Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Offices. We know how That, and
Scripture hath been interpreted upon other Occaſions: In leſs than half a
Century, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Certain Revolution, One Side ſaid, God ſhewd his
Indignation in Thunder and Lightning: T'other, That he Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated the
Succeſs with his Guns and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works from above. <hi>Plato</hi> in his time
ſaid, Lawyers and Phyſicians were the Peſt of a Country: Would he not
have added, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines alſo; had he lived in ſome other Ages?</p>
               <p>When theſe Gentlemen were upon their Providential Diſpoſal
and Settlement of Kingdoms, They might as juſtly have brought ſome
Inſtances from Scripture, which would have been for the Honour of the
Revolution. Where God vouchſaf'd his Aſſiſtance to a good Cauſe for a
Bleſſing to a People (as well as always for a Curſe to a Bad and Sinful
Nation) Inſtances which comply and would have ſtood with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Rules of Morality and Human Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. As the Caſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> and
his Son,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61249:101"/> between <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and
<hi>Joſiah,</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Tyrants, and Wicked Princes. Alſo in
the Caſe of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> where God ſeems to give a Countenance to the
Revolt of the Ten Tribes, and aſſiſt againſt his Tyranny and
Oppreſſion; for God ſays, 'twas his doing there alſo. <hi>David</hi>
ſeems to agree with this: He ſufficiently differences his Expreſſions,
according to the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Princes and Rulers, as good or bad: He tells us
the Fate of wicked ones, not by executing upon them God's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate perſonal
Judgments, or by the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hand of Providence; but by Human Mediums of
interpoſing Power to reſtrain them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Favour of God's
Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in an Ordinary Courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Juſtice: The
Prophets did not preach Paſſive Obedience to the Idolatrous Kings of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> but inveigh'd againſt them. Did not
<hi>David</hi> and his Adherents reſiſt <hi>Saul,</hi> though he ſpared
his Perſon: (I do not pretend to plead for a Vindictive Account againſt the
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Kings) And the Story of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> methinks ſeems
ſomething toward ours: He Set up, Repaired, Adorn'd, and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the
Altars, Temples, and High Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which the Devil was by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Worſhipp'd, forgetting the Piety of his Father, and moſt abominably burnt
his Sons for a Sacrifice to the Devil,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61249:102"/> 
                  <hi>Moloch,</hi> and ſhed ſo much
innocent Blood, that 'tis ſaid, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd
therewith. And when after all, he was reprehended by the Reverend Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſai,</hi> he caus'd him to be Saw'd aſunder with a Wooden Saw.
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his Sins, the Lord brought upon him the Captains of the Hoſt
of the Kings of <hi>Aſhur,</hi> who took <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and put him
in Fetters, and bound him in Chains, and carried him to <hi>Babel,</hi> where,
after he had lain Twenty Years as a Captive, deſpoiled of all Honour and
Hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchief, God inſpir'd him with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and afterwards
mov'd the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Heart to deliver him; after which he forgot
his Impieties and Villanies, deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Idolatry, caſt down the Idols of
his own Erection, repaired <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at laſt Dyed in a
Religious Peace. But 'tis not my Province to apply Scripture, only to my
ſelf: And I know not what Commiſſion They have ſo familiarly to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Councils of the Almighty.
<q>'Tis true, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, Nothing is
ſenſibly and viſibly done in the World, which cometh not from the
Interior and Inviſible Cabinet of God, whether it be commanded or
permitted;</q> though ſome will not allow a permiſſive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet
the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Oh God! How profound are thy thoughts! and how
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61249:102"/> 
                  <hi>to the ignorant and fooliſh?</hi>
Yet Man muſt be preſently making Inferences. Providence is ſaid to take
care of the moſt minute Creatures, as well as the greateſt. And theſe
great Texts and Stories of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Supremacy, with Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to each
other, are only taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; whilſt Others as poſitive lye dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant;
as, <hi>Reſiſt not evil; Turn t'other Cheek;</hi> and about giving the
Cloak alſo. Theſe might do miſchief, and the Wicked of the World might
take Advantage by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon the Exhorters. The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the
World runs otherwiſe, and the Proſpect is too Melancholy, where there is no
Sunſhine in the Landſcape.</p>
               <p>If then neither the Hiſtorical part of the Old Teſtament,
nor the Doctrinal parts of the New, nor the certain Authority of Councils or
Convocations, nor the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial Opinions of Divines, do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
evince our Duty of blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Non-reſiſtance, under a total
ſubverſion of a Conſtitution in Church and State, and the Practice of the
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, in all places is counter to it; Why are theſe Gentlemen
ſo ſevere upon us, and ſo reſty themſelves? Lay the Scene in
<hi>Holland, Germany, France,</hi> (where a Holy League is no News) or
<hi>Portugal, &amp;c.</hi> Reſiſtance is an Orthodox
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61249:103"/> Doctrine; but put the Caſe at Home, it
muſt be Heretical, and no leſs than Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Why muſt
<hi>Engliſh-men</hi> be the only Cullyes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and have their
hands ti'd? Although the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> does not pretend to follow
the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe they never
thought to betray their own Church to that, by ſetting up a contrary
Doctrine. <hi>Suarez de Legibus</hi> acquaints us with the Popiſh Doctrine,
expreſly in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That Heathen Kings can't be depriv'd of their power by War,
unleſs they abuſe it, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of Chriſtian Religion, or the
Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Faithful that are under them, as is the conſtant
Opinion of Divines, meaning of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q> And again, If
Infidels have the Faithful for their Subjects, and would turn them from the
Faith or Obedience of the Church, then the Church hath juſt cauſe of War
againſt them: But for Heretick Princes, he ſays, the Church hath Direct
power over them, and may deprive them in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Infidelity or
Hereſy. This we ſaw verified in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſhe by
Advice of her Divines, in preſervation of Church turn'd the Tables upon them.
I do not believe any of our Divines are ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to betray their
Church, and yield to the Pope, or any one commiſſion'd by him, their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61249:103"/> Dignities and Revenues, though they
Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over the Nobility and Gentry to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for preſerving them in
poſſeſſion of them. I mean they who have taken the Oaths to the
Government, as a King <hi>de facto,</hi> for I believe the Others who are not
come in, are more charitable; for I confeſs I have an Honourable pity for
them, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue them never the leſs for ſticking to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though
they are unfortunate, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from me in Judgment. But beſides the
Buſineſs of Religion, the Papiſts ought not to be angry with us, for
Depoſing or Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a King; they are uneaſy as ſoon as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and do
not take the Paſſive Doctrine to be any Reſtraint upon them, even in the
ill Adminiſtration of a Popiſh King; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Story of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Advance of the Duke of
<hi>Braganza.</hi> And here at home to look back and inſtance only in
<hi>Edward</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, who, as the Hiſtory ſays, being govern'd by
<hi>Gave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and the <hi>Spencers,</hi> murder'd his Uncle
<hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and numbers of Great men, The
People, the Popiſh People, roſe againſt him, Impriſon'd him, and a full
Repeſentative of the Nation, in a ſolemn manner renounced their Allegiance
to him; but told him withal, they would ſuffer his Son <hi>Edward</hi> to
ſucceed, which was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it ſeems, in thoſe Times. Therefore, I
think, the Papiſts, whether they conſider
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61249:104"/> their Doctrine or their Practice, can't
hit us in the Teeth juſtly: Their only Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is, That the Perſon is
miſtaken, and doth not prove for their turn. And I do not doubt,
notwithſtanding Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Settlement, they would endeavour to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move King <hi>William,</hi> for King <hi>James,</hi> or any other Popiſh
King again: And I can't blame them for it, for 'tis their Principle; but as
Gentlemen they ought to give us leave to enjoy our fancy too. And ſo to look
into our own Church-men, who would ſeem to mince the matter, either in their
Principles or Practice; They tell us a Story of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and endeavour to parallel the firſt with King
<hi>James</hi> II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and juſtify the latter for making War upon him, by whom
they intimate King <hi>William;</hi> but they manage it ſo ſcurvily, on and
off, that one knows not where to have them; they would, and they would not, as
if they were aſham'd of their Paſſive Doctrine, and yet aſham'd to quit
it. The Biſhop of <hi>A.</hi> allows a Foreign Prince to make War upon
Another, who proſecutes his Subjects for Religion, if the Religion be his
that makes War, for that reaſon; and what is this more than hath been ſaid
before? But <hi>Puffendorf</hi> ſpeaks boldly, and allows alſo Subjects to
uſe an Abſolute Prince as an Enemy, if he diſcovers an Hoſtile Mind
towards them. We keep a Clutter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61249:104"/> filial Obedience to the Patriarchal Power,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Puffendorf</hi> grounds even the Paternal Power over
Children upon their preſum'd Conſent, and ſays, 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Sons may,
when they come of Age; chuſe whether they will be under their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Government, or not. And here (by way of Parentheſis,) a Man might raiſe an
unlucky Diſpute; Whether there be any Government Legal and Rightful, but what
is only obtain'd by Conſent? For if this be true, it will go a great way in
the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even of their Patriarchal Power, which for this reaſon cannot
be Abſolute, and no Other way can give any Right at all; for Conqueſt is
but an overgrown Treſpaſs upon the Poſſeſſion and Right of another:
And if there be no Government, but by Conſent of the Governed, whether the
People's Conſent will carry a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment farther without a ſubſequent
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Approbation? And the Conſequence of that, when we Swear
Allegiance to a King, be not that it is to be underſtood no farther than he
governs by Law; and that our Allegiance is due to Law, not to the perſon of a
King? Whether theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations may not be offer'd with as good a
Colour, as ſome others have been? Whether Kings do not mean this, when the
conſent of the People is ask'd? Or whether they mean nothing? Whether 'tis
not underſtood
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61249:105"/> by the conſent, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> We
might alſo enquire, how our Gentlemen came to be wiſer and more
ſcrupulous in their Allegiance than their Forefathers? And what Titles
<hi>William</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Henry</hi> I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, K. <hi>John,</hi> K.
<hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, Henry</hi> IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had, if not by
Conſent? We might far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ask them, If this Patriarchal, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick,
Abſolute Power be the Right of Kings, and Non-Reſiſtance is not Lawful
upon any occaſion whatſoever, Why they are not Unanimous in their Doctrine?
And what Lay-men are to do when there is a Schiſm in the Church? But theſe
may be thought invidious Queries?</p>
               <p>But what if theſe Paſſive-Gentlemen are not conſiſtent
with themſelves? 'Tis plain, our Divines here were not ſo ſtiff to the
firſt Motions of the Prince's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for our Reſcue. He himſelf tells
us, that Several of the Lords Spiritual as as Temporal were in the Inviting of
him over; and the Diſſenting Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who thought fit to draw back
afterwards, was pleaſed to Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his coming to <hi>London,</hi> and to
aſſiſt with his Counſels. He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be in the
<hi>Sanhedrim</hi> upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy; which by his favour was as far from being
Paſſive, as Harneſſing and Equipping,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61249:105"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeveral Noblemen
with their Chaplains at their Elbows agreed upon the firſt Overtures
againſt King <hi>James,</hi> who only differ'd after in the Form of
Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and ſupplying the Power. There were thoſe who would have
been contented and ſatisfied with a Regency, which by the by was as much
againſt the late Notions of Loyalty; and 'twas once taught, that it was as
Damnable to put any Reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a King, or Fetter his Prerogative, or to
limit the Meaſures of our Obedience, as to cancel and throw them off.</p>
               <p>If then there be no ſteady Obſtruction in our way, no
Irrefragable Arguments, but what are Overturn'd or Embarraſs'd; Why may we
not throw off the Mask, and declare our ſelves frankly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And
talk as becomes Gentlemen or Free-born Creatures, of Reaſon, and tell the
World, That King <hi>James</hi> was no longer fit to be entruſted with the
Government; That he could give no Adequate Security for his Adminiſtration:
That it was no more in his Power, than his Will, to Rule according to Law: That
it could not be therefore ſafe to Re-admit him on any Terms, becauſe he
would not be reſtrain'd by any Qualifications. In ſhort, That King
<hi>Jamess</hi> Character and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are inconſiſtent and
incompatible with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61249:106"/> the Laws of this Realm; and that
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary, That the
Government ſhould be ſupplied, and ſome Other Perſon admitted and
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Throne, from, and by whom might be aſſur'd he would
Obſerve and Maintain the Conſtitution in Church and State: And that for
theſe Reaſons, we have admitted King <hi>William</hi> to the Crown, allow'd
him to take the Government as King of <hi>England,</hi> and conſented to
transfer our Allegiance to him; and have Recognized, Acknowledged, and
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared His Majeſty, (he having accepted the Crown and Royal Dignity) To be
of Right, and by the Laws of this Realm, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord and King, of
<hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions thereunto
belonging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If our Principles are juſt, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt be ſo
too. If the Premiſes be true, the Concluſion is warrantable.
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign</hi> ſays, Authority is not given in favour of the
Magiſtrate, but of the People: And 'tis the general Opinion, That Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made for them, whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally it were made by them, or not. All the
reſpective Schemes of it are contrived to provide for the Welfare of the
Community; and the Laws and Conſtitutions of Power are
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61249:106"/> the Meaſures of Submiſſion to it.
Thus the Notions of Providence and Human Right may be underſtood, and
conſiſt in Human Underſtanding. Kings and Subjects may know their Duties;
Kings may preſerve their Rights ſo long as they continue to be (Rational)
Men; and Man may preſerve his Native Honour in the Character of his firſt
Creation, as he was made after God's Image alſo.</p>
               <p>Thus I hope this Preſent King may at laſt reſt in Peace,
being ſetled by ſuch a <hi>Recognition,</hi> and guarded by an
<hi>Aſſociation</hi> in Parliament. Though 'tis hard to imagine how the
Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one came to be boggled at, after ſuch a Declared Right in
Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Oaths of Allegiance taken to it.</p>
               <p>And long may He live to Aſſert the Rights of the People; To
adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and to retrieve the Honour of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
by vindicating it from the Encroachments ſuffer'd (not to ſay conſented
to) in the late Reigns.</p>
